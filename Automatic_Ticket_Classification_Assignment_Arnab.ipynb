              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I am writing you to file a complaint about an unresolved issue with my credit card chase and their benefit and travel departments. This has been my second travel related credit issue with chase. My first experience with chase was also about a credit that they were supposed to process. Chase was either unresponsive or slow. I finally ended up contacting the airlines directly and got a much quicker response and resolution from them. \\n\\nMy more recent issue with Chase has been my most stressful and frustrating experience when dealing with any credit card company or for that matter any other company that offers products or services. I am a Chase Sapphire card holder who has been using the card regularly for purchases amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars every month. I have an excellent payment history with most of the bills paid in full every month. \\n\\n\\nIn XXXX  of 2019, I bought my XXXX airline ticket for an overseas trip through Chase using my accumulated Chase points. My father passed away overseas a week before my trip. I had to cancel my original trip and leave immediately so I called chase to cancel my ticket. Despite, under a lot of stress and in grief, I had to be on the phone with them for hours. I was put on long holds, transferred to different departments and still did not receive a definitive answer about cancelation of my trip and credit to my account. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the last customer representative that I spoke with that night, they had to send an email to a different department and that I could follow up with them the following week by Tuesday or Wednesday as they would have processed my cancelation by then. Unfortunately, It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to be calling from overseas and be on the phone with the credit card company for hours. I had to authorize my husband to follow up on my behalf the following week before his upcoming trip overseas as he had to leave on XX/XX/XXXX, which was our original plan. \\n\\n\\nMy husband called them few times and went through the same process of being on the phone for hours either being on hold or being transferred to different departments. He spoke with the main customer service, the benefits and the chase travel. Initially, a representative advised him to contact XXXX  directly to cancel my ticket. Finally, after further research, the same representative that he spoke to in the benefit department told him that we should expect to receive a credit because of the death in the family, The representative assigned us a case number and told my husband that Chase would get the refund from XXXX on our behalf. According to him, all we needed was a death certificate. Since we were both expected to be out of the country for few weeks, the representative told my husband that the credit could be processed anytime upon our return or soon after the Chase received the death certificate from us. \\n\\nIn XXXX, while still overseas, I received an e-mail on XXXX, XXXX from XXXX in Chase travel who was following up with the death certificate. I e-mailed Chase travel department the scanned copy of the death certificate as soon as it became available to me. I even e-mailed them a translation of the death certificate which was neither required by Chase or XXXX. I sent it to XXXX who had contacted me on XXXX, XXXX by responding to her e-mail from XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded it again to her to make sure that they received it. For personal and family reasons, I ended up staying a little longer than expected and retuned to the United States on XXXX. There was still no acknowledgment from XXXX or anyone from Chase Travel or any other department acknowledging the receipt of my e-mail from XXXX or any other update. Soon after my return, I had to send the travel department my father 's death certificate for the third time and even tried to follow up with a phone call. I also tried to send them an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX, expressing my disappointment and requesting an update. I also tried to correspond with Chase customer service and Chase travel through my online chase account. \\n\\nChase travel finally responded with an acknowledgement through an e-mail that they had received and located the death certificate that I had sent them. The e-mail was from XXXX, one of the Travel consultant supervisor for chase travel. According to her, they had forwarded the death certificate to XXXX. She apologized for my experience with them and also asked me to disregard any other emails from them requesting documentation. During this whole ordeal with Chase, I had contacted XXXX numerous times and spoke to different representatives. According to XXXX, In order for Chase to process my credit, they didn't need to forward the death certificate to XXXX. \\n\\nIn one of my initials calls to Chase after my return to the United States, I found out that the case number / reference number assigned to us and given to my husband by the by chase benefits department in XXXX could not be used as a reference because I was told that it did not exist in their system. In XXXX and XXXX, I spoke to several people and few supervisors hoping that they could resolve my issue. Customer service agents who seemed willing to help did not have the authority to resolve my issue as there was no outcome and I ended up wasting several hours without any resolution in sight. \\n\\nThere was one supervisor in Chase travel department, which was probably being managed by XXXX, named XXXX, whom I ended up speaking with twice. During our brief conversation, She flatly refused to help me or answer any questions. She had the most condescending attitude that I have ever experienced from an agent affiliated with any company. She refused to give me an update or call XXXX. She refused to transfer me to her manager or anyone that could assist me. To top it all, she told me I needed a proof that I was related to the deceased which was contrary to what I had been told up till that point that all I needed was a death certificate. I called XXXX and according to them, a proof of relationship was not necessary or required. XXXX told me that it was their policy that all that was needed was a death certificate and Chase should have processed my credit as soon as they received it. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I emailed and I called Chase few times and each time I was promised that a supervisor would get back to me which never happened. One of the last representatives that that I spoke with was on XXXX, XXXX, who was from Chase benefits department. To my utter shock and surprise, he told me that they didn't have any type of claim for me on file. I was beyond hope at that point. He then transferred me once again to their travel department. The representative there told me that they were still waiting to hear from XXXX. I requested to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would be two hours before I could speak with one. She promised that a supervisor would call me back but as always, I never heard from anyone. \\n\\nAfter several weeks on the phone with Chase and after speaking to XXXX multiple times who repeatedly told me that the delay was from Chase, I finally decided that I would wait and see if the issue would be resolved. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Chase has still not processed my credit and followed up or called back in response to any of my previous phone calls even when they promised that I would receive a phone call. \\n\\nI have finally decided that I am going to file a formal complaint with every private, state and federal consumer protection agency or organization. I would share my experience on any relevant online or offline forums available to me. I have been a great customer. I may have been frustrated with my experience but have always been respectful in my communications with Chase or its representatives. I have been managing my credit responsibly over the years, had several premium credit card offers as I had met their criteria to apply for their cards with similar benefits as Chase Sapphire. I decided to go with Chase and was hopeful that I would take advantage of their travel benefits. I spent thousands of dollars using my Chase card even though some of my other cards also offered attractive benefits. \\n\\nAs stated earlier, I fulfilled my obligation of using credit responsibly and of paying my bills. Chase on the other hand, failed to issue me a credit and fulfill its promise. A timely credit, under the circumstances, was my right. It was according to and within the rules set by both the Chase and XXXX Airlines. Unfortunately, I was never able to utilize the points that I had accumulated. A credit card company at the very least should treat every customer with respect, follow their own rules, keep their promises and follow up with their customers and if required and within the rules, be its customer 's adovocate on his or her behalf when dealing with third parties. I feel that Chase fell short of these basic standards and expectations. It with deep regret that I have to reconsider my business relationship with them. It is a shame that a well known company like Chase offering a premium card such as, Chase Sapphire and charging a $ XXXX yearly membership fee for it, would have such a poor service. It is either a case of extreme mismanagement by chase or a system deliberately designed in such a way that it only benefits the company at the expense of its customers.\n",

Early in XXXX I became the XXXX XXXX of the US office of a XXXX company. The U.S. office of the company was incorporated in Delaware as a separate entity. There is a sole owner who also owned the XXXX based entity. \\nOur bank was Chase, and XXXX XXXX our bank contact, based on a relationship with prior foreign company I had been running at the same location with the same infrastructure and bookkeeper. XXXX relationship with Mr. XXXX dated from from XXXX or XXXX. The Chase relationship dated from XXXX. \\n\\nIn early XXXX of XXXX I asked XXXX XXXX about a small line of credit. The company produced TV commercial and in production oftentimes equipment and locations need to be paid in advance, or require deposits. In addition there is travel. I had been using my own ( personal ) credit card. Given XXXX was slow in paying us money owed, I was getting concerned. \\n\\nXXXX called me a few days later and said he had a better solution and put me in touch with XXXX XXXX, at the bank, to open a company credit card. He assured me it would be set up as a corporate card and I would have no liability. I reiterated I was doing this as I was using my own card and did not want any liability. \\nThe card application was made on-line during a phone call with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX initiated the call.. After we spoke, he transferred me to XXXX XXXX. She guided me through the process. I specifically said to her I did not want the card if I would be liable if something happened with the company. I explained that I knew of instances where employee had cards in their names and were held liable. She clearly told me I was covered in the event of any kind of default. She told me the company was responsible and I was \" protected '' ( her word ) On that same call XXXX guided me through the on-line application. I never signed anything. The official card date of issue is XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI left XXXX at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and closed the office for them, although the company was kept open. The part time bookkeeper stayed on. The XXXX company declared insolvency in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX in the US has never actually closed. The owner stopped responding to anything in XXXX. The XXXX Chase Bank account remains open with a small balance. \\n\\nDuring the last week XXXX of XXXX, when I closed the physical office of XXXX XXXX in the US. Everything was given to the part time bookkeeper who was the one that handled all the financial affairs and bank business. She was known to XXXX XXXX and had interacted on a regular basis. She was given the checkbook and the card, and she had all current records. All further Chase business should be would be forwarded to her P.O. box. The monthly statements had always gone to the company address. \\n\\nThe day I closed the office I went up to my Chase branch and spoke to my banking contact XXXX XXXX. I told him I had left and the physical office was closed. I explained that the bookkeeper was taking over. I informed him I was no longer a signatory on checks and she had the card in her possession. \\nSome time in XXXX I contacted XXXX on a personal banking matter and when my leaving was referenced he claimed he had no idea and denied I ever came to see him. Not sure why. Perhaps he genuinely forgot. I asked him if the card needed to be closed. But he was rather argumentative. He said he would take care of it. He contacted XXXX XXXX. That resulted in the following email exchange that you will see below. \\n\\nXXXX, XXXX XXXX had left XXXX XXXX this past XXXX. Please advise on having him removed from these business accounts. Bill can be reached at XXXX. Thank you. \\nRegards, XXXX XXXX At that point XXXX asked me for the book keeper 's phone number which I supplied to her. That was the extent of her correspondence. The card was kept open and the bank continued to do business with the corporate entity. I heard nothing back from that point on. There was nothing from her about any liability or action regarding the card. The bank never contacted me, or sent me bills or notices, ( despite their claim to the contrary in the attached XX/XX/XXXX letter to my attorney ). Nor was I informed if the account was closed or kept open, or closed. They had a home address for me, and a telephone number. XXXX XXXX did not contact me after that. As noted, she knew I was gone, and card was left open and the bank continued on doing business with the company, and payments were ongoing for a time after that. \\n\\nThe monthly payments continued to be made by the company and were accepted by the bank. The last one was as of XX/XX/XXXX. At some point the XXXX based owner walked way from his obligations and it appears the card was rendered inactive. ( When I was able to retrieve all the records for the account there was nothing between that XXXX statement and one issued XX/XX/XXXX. ) However the company was never closed. And as of earlier this year there is still a bank account with a balance. However the account has been frozen. \\n\\nMost importantly that correspondence from XXXX XXXX was the last I heard from Chase or anyone about he account, until Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. This was over two years after leaving the company. I received the attached notice, mailed to my home, from XXXX XXXX. I had never received a bill or notice at my home address. \\n\\nI contacted XXXX XXXX by email about it. Her email response : I have looked into the credit card ending in XXXX This credit card is issued in the business name, with your self as personal guarantor. That is why I believe you are getting the communication from XXXX XXXX. The last transaction on the card ( purchase transaction ) is from XX/XX/XXXX, but there were payments made each month until XX/XX/XXXX at which time the payments stopped and a late fee has been charged plus the interested each month. \\n\\n( E-mails are attached ) I further asked her about any signature and a closing date. Her response : I am looking into a documentthere may not be one, as one wasnt needed in XXXX Opened XX/XX/XXXX, there is no closed date listedit is in charged off status She also told me statements were available on line. They were not. I called the bank 3 times and they promised statements within 10 days at my home address. They never came. I was finally able to get them printed at a branch. \\n\\nThe notices continued with XXXX offering to reduce the amount of {$29000.00} to around {$11000.00} and a proposed payment plan. I hired legal representation. My attorney then contacted XXXX and said all correspondence should go to him. He explained our stance that I am not liable and this is corporate debt, and outlined the reasons. At that point XXXX returned the debt to Chase. Chase then responded to my lawyer in correspondence received XX/XX/XXXX. ( Attached ). A summation from my lawyer : Chase finally responded. They claim you are responsible personally because you applied in your name with your SSN. They attached a form showing the information. They also attached an Agreement that says, in its section headed Legal Responsibility that says that the person who applied for the account and gave his/her SSN is responsible. \\nChase closes by pointing out that they may close out the account if it is not paid and then report the debt as forgiven,,, the IRS will expect you to pay income taxes on the amount forgiven, {$29000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThey further claimed in the attached document that \" We kept sending monthly statements to XXXX XXXX XXXX until the account charged off on or about XX/XX/XXXX. '' This is not true. \\n\\nIn referencing my liability they used my home address in XXXX on XXXX. I never received a bill or notice there during the entire time the account was opened and closed. That address was only used by the collection agency. And my last communication was in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my attorney sent a letter to the XXXX owner notifying him of the debt. ( Attached ). He has not responded, On XX/XX/XXXX my lawyer called the bank at the number provided on the XX/XX/XXXX correspondence that was sent by the bank after XXXX XXXX returned the debt to the bank. He asked that the IRS debt forgiveness be assigned to XXXX and not me. And said if paid a small amount just to end this and so as not to keep paying him was that possible. They said no to both. They advised him to write to a chase address in Delaware. My Lawyer sent a letter to Chase at the Delaware Address ( attached ) on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. In early XXXX we had not heard from the Delaware office. They finally returned a call to my lawyer on XX/XX/XXXX. The person from Chase said they had not read the letter and further stated he had been told the XX/XX/XXXX letter was valid. My lawyer responded that the letter raised specific questions and we wanted answers to those questions. The representative said he would report back the comments. We have yet to hear back. \\n\\nIn addition to the IRS, this has also been reported to the major credit bureaus. My credit record was excellent until this appeared.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I received an offer from Chase XXXX Visa promising a companion airline pass XXXX bonus points for opening a Chase XXXX Visa card. I applied for the card online in XX/XX/XXXX providing my current email address, phone number and address. I was approved. In XXXX I requested paperless billing statements/correspondence and assumed that my current contact information provided at time of approval would be utilized by Chase for the XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nHaving previous Chase credit card products I was able to log into my online account and setup automatic bill payment for my account. I used my card as needed to earn the companion pass and bonus points and assumed the auto payments were being made from my checking account as I viewed line items that had Chase in the description and as I was not receiving paper statements/emails or phone calls from Chase regarding my XXXX account. \\n\\nIn reviewing my checking account statement in XXXX and realizing the that the Chase line item was actually an auto payment for one of my husbands credit cards and was not in fact for the XXXX Visa card I reached out to Chase XXXX Visa immediately. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to the customer service phone number listed on the back of my card ( Payments are due on the XXXX of the month ) to learn that I was 34 days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take 1-2 business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect. \\n\\nAdditionally, I learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information I had provided at the time of application. \\n\\nI made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance, requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future. \\n\\nThey made notation in the account of the challenge, reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late payment would not be reported to the credit bureau due to the banking error. Also confirmed that I had met the required spend to earn the bonus and given the banking error, reversal of late charges, payment in full and notation that I would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which I HAVE received. This reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end. \\n\\nAll subsequent payments have been made on time and as of XX/XX/XXXX the account has a {$12.00} balance due to charges made after payment in full. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX alert service that I subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from XXXX to XXXX. I opened the XXXX file which stated a late payment was reported by Chase for XXXX. I filed a dispute and in XXXX received an email from XXXX  stating the dispute had been resolved. Upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed. \\n\\nI contacted Chase XXXX Visa, explained the negative reporting, the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges. They stated that the \" Credit Bureau Unit '' was not currently open and requested I call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information. \\n\\nI followed the advice and spoke with XXXX, CBU specialist in the XXXX, MO call center. After a long period of discussion XXXX informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau. \\n\\nAfter requesting all notation on my file he advised I send a fax to the \" Business Office '' at ( XXXX ) XXXX but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that I could send the request to. \\n\\nI asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to XXXX customer service. \\n\\nIn speaking with XXXX in customer service I believed that I was still speaking to the Credit Bureau department. I recalled all events, she confirmed the notation in the account. Additionally, I advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on XX/XX/XXXX my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all Chase accounts. I was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account I received a screen that stated that I needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbers/email that were pre-populated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information. I had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once I was able to gain access into the account I confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the DEFAULT contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information. \\n\\nI explained to her that when I tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account. She assisted with updating on her end, had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information. \\n\\nGiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup I asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting. At this point SHE ADVISED ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE CREDIT BUREAU DEPARTMENT and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done. I explained that I had already spoken with XXXX in that department and that I was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her. She stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to 5 days to provide a call back. \\n\\nShe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named XXXX, explained the situation and XXXX told her that there \" was nothing that he could do to assist ''. \\n\\nI have never been late with a payment across all accounts. I have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with JP Morgan Chase/XXXX. As a result of Chase/XXXX XXXX it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment & provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that I will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from \" Outstanding '' to \" Good '' and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered. \\n\\nI am reaching out to you in hopes that you will be able to 1 ) Assist with restoring my credit due to banking/IT error on the part of the credit card issuer 2 ) By sharing my story prevent another person from being lured into getting a credit card from Chase and have to deal with the same challenges I have faced.\n",

Thank you for choosing Chase. \\n\\n\\nWHAT IS DECEPTION This communication portends several issues from my perspective ; first there is a matter of dubious candor as articulated in the plain language of California CIV 1709 1710, which articulate the following : CIVIL CODE-CIV DIVISION 3. OBLIGATIONS [ 1427 -3272.9 ] ( Heading of Division 3 amended by Stats. 1988. Ch. 160, Sec 14 ) Part 3. OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY LAW [ 1708 1725 ] ( Part 3 enacted 1872. ) 1709. One, who willfully deceives  another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers. \\n1710. A deceit, within the meaning of the last section, is either : 1. The suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true ; 2. The assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true ; 3. The suppression of a fact, by one who is bound to disclose it, or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact ; or, 4. A promise, made without any intention of performing it.\\n\\n( enacted 1872 ) BACK AND FORTH BANTERING : Emails dispersed from myself to Ms. XXXX XXXX and my wife to Ms. XXXX XXXX, [ cc and her supervisor, Mr. XXXX XXXX eventually, Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX ] from the period of XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX indicate a pattern of deception enumerated in CIV 1710 ( 1 4 ) and may concurrently be in contravention of GOV 12927 ( c ) ( 1 ), which articulates the following narrative in part : GOVERNMENT CODE - GOV TLE 2.

JP Morgan Chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering Loan Terms and Interest Rate to me and my wife. \\n\\n2. She lied when she presented to me and my wife that JP Morgan Chase selection of the lowest Fico Score was due to Chases Guideline ( s ) /Policy. \\n\\n3. When we asked for a copy of Chases Guidelines, she and her Manager, Mr. XXXX lied when they stated that JP Morgan Chase Guidelines are Internal documents and are not given out. \\n\\n4. When Ms. XXXX tried to cover Ms. XXXX lie. XXXX XXXX instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written Quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because Chase does meet their Competitors Pricing and Interest Rate. However, when we submitted a written Quote from a competitor, Mr. XXXX in support of Ms. XXXX stated in an email communication that Chase DOES NOT meet competitors pricing and since we had NOT provided a {$500.00} Good Faith Fee and did not submit all documentation [ which we did ] we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the XXXX Fico Score and Pricing or cancel the process. \\n\\n5. Ms. XXXX email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors Pricing/Interest Rate using a XXXX Fico Score as Ms. XXXX instructed us to do with the words, where did you get this from. Never addressing that fact that the Interest Rate quoted was 3.625 % and we did what she asked of us.\\n\\n6. Ms. XXXX was asked NOT to load ANY of the cost into the Loan. She did it anyway and when asked several times to update the Loan Amount she did not complete that task until Friday, XXXX XXXX evening when she was on her way out the door for the week. \\n\\n7. Ms. XXXX lied when she sent me the initial MyHomeChase email to login and/or create login credentials in order to begin the process. Ms. XXXX FAILED to provide me with the Loan Application Number. When my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the 24 hours account creation expired, Ms. XXXX stated that she did not provide the Loan Application Number because she wanted me to give her a call when I discovered that I could not move forward. \\n\\n8. It was during my wife phone conference with Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX that he confirmed the lies that Ms. XXXX represented on behalf of Chase. It was disclosed that Chase DOES uses the Middle Fico Score not the lowest. It was also disclosed that Chase did not have any such Guideline ( s ) /Policy of using the lowest Fico Score as previously represented to us by Ms. XXXX XXXX It was disclosed that Ms. XXXX did NOT 10 years of experience as a Home Loan Advisor with Chase. Mr. XXXX further confirmed that Ms. XXXX has worked for Chase for several years as a Teller along with assisting other Loan Advisors. I believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that Ms. XXXX has worked on ALONE. \\n\\nMr. XXXX in Good Faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to Chases XXXX location, but my wife decided to give Ms. XXXX the benefit-of-the doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process. \\nI believe Mr. XXXX XXXX stated to my wife that he had a conversation with Ms. XXXX regarding the issues. \\n\\nHowever, it was a BIG MISTAKE to leave Ms. XXXX in place. It also appears that the conversation that Mr. XXXX had with Ms. XXXX DID NOT WORK! \\nThroughout Friday, XX/XX/XXXX late afternoon Ms. XXXX sent me several misleading emails informing me that my Loan Documents were ready for me to login to MyHomeChase to complete the loan application process and to paid the {$500.00} Good Faith Fee. \\n\\nI emailed her to alert her that the documents had NOT been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents. She then sent me another email late Friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents. I waited for I believe 2 hours and I emailed her back to share with her that I had not received the separate email. Later in the afternoon/early evening my wife placed a call to her. Her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nShortly, after that the separate email arrived. I login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the OLD documents. I email Ms. XXXX back with both Mr. XXXX & Mr. XXXX on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting Ms. XXXX with hanging the revised documents. Neither Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX responded. \\n\\nHowever, Ms. XXXX did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on Monday and that the only thing she did was to change the Loan Amount. \\nShe went on to let me know that Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nIn conclusion, as far as I am concerned ALL of the above behavior is a clear representation of Unfair Business Practices and Fraudulent Business Practices which my last email on Friday, XXXX XXXX that Mr. XXXX responded back to and forward to his Executive Office clearly reflects my DISDAINED for being subjected to [ 2 Trusted Agents of JP Morgan Chase ], Ms. XXXX and Mr. XXXX Fraudulent and Unlawful Conduct.\n",

They asked if i had given any one my card number and allowed them to use my card online again i said no. They said okay thank you and closed out these debit cards and would send me new one and i should see a temporary credit on my account for these transactions while they investigated I said great thank you so much. So I got online and printed off all the transactions for my accounts for the last three months and started going thru them and matching them with my receipts. I noticed I had missed some transactions ( seriously there were so many transactions ) and so I called chase bank and explained and asked if i could get these added to the reports they stated no they couldnt do that they had to open 3 more fraud reports. I said ok went thru everything again and again they said I would see credit in the next 12 hours. Ok awesome, So the new cards arrive I activate them and over the next 24/48 hours I use them sparingly just things like gas groceries etc. again nothing online or over {$100.00}. Well I log back on to check my accounts and notice all our accounts were drained or negative. So i start looking at the accounts thinking maybe the credits hadn't hit or they were still processing etc. Nope there was more fraud this time on all 3 of my brand new debit cards. I was shocked I called chase again and asked if this was normal what was going on etc etc. I was told its normal around this time of year with the holdidays etc. So I started new reports but this time was told I not only had to open seperate ones for each account but now also for each vendor. So i said ok and they said the same thing ok theyd investigate close out my cards/ send me new ones and issue credits. This time ( when I received my new cards about a week later ) and after I had called and activated them I only put one of them in my wallet the other two I put in our safe. I checked our accounts and saw the credits and went thru and compared the credits to the fraudulent charges I had reported I noticed that over 10 of the transactions I reported as fraudulent chase had accidentally missed. So again I called and let them know and again even tho i had already reported them they had to start new reports etc. okay again no big deal. I had this 2nd set of new debit cards in hand and activated less than 48 hours and I log on to see if they had reported the rest of the transactions and low and behold more fraud. Even on the cards that were completely untouched and in my safe!!! On the other one I had made a total of two purchases with one for {$6.00} at the pharmacy for my XXXX XXXX daughter and the other one for {$25.00} on gas. I was completely dumbfounded. So I immediately called chase again this was XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX XXXX and reported the charges and asked what I could do could I close the accounts and open new ones with new bank account numbers? I had already changed my password on my chase account. They said no they couldn't do that till all these reports had been investigated. I said okay and filed the new reports and just decided I wouldn't even activate them this time I would just go into chase and pull off cash and use that till all this gets worked out. They again said no problem they would then close the cards send new ones etc. I asked them what I could do and how this could be happening they just said they didn't know but fraud happens alot this time of year. I said okay thank you etc. At about XXXX that XXXX   I went to log on to my chase account to check and make sure they got everything and it wouldnt let me log into my account it said to call chase for further info and help. So I call chase and they informed me that they had restricted and closing all my accounts due to a large number of fraud complaints. I told them that was them I only had 3 fraud reports they were the ones that turned each transaction into a seperate claim. I asked how I was going to get access to our money all of our money was in those accounts ( bills, my kids XXXX, everything I wan na say not even including the fraud there was at least {$2000.00} between the accounts plus my husbands paycheck was getting direct deposited friday and my daughters child support and social security XXXX. They said that I could go into a branch and pull off the funds but that the account was restricted and all deposits and transactions would be denied/ blocked and returned. They said the account would stay restricted for the next 10 business days while they finished investigating the claims and that when they were done they would close the accounts and the remaining balances would be sent to us by check 10 business days after that ( so probably by mid XXXX because of the holidays ) I said I would be going to the branch now and withdrawing the funds. I had to we needed that money we had rent due on the XXXX, electric, phones everything all due and I needed to get my kids stuff for XXXX still as we are a low income family my husband is a XXXX XXXX XXXX veteren, I am XXXX XXXX and we have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX children. So we have to really save and budget. We have almost no spare income but all our bills are always on time. So i go into the branch and with my XXXX kids to withdraw the funds like they told me to. I get to the teller and she looks everything up and writes down my account balances the main account without the fraud money or credits was {$420.00} the 2nd account was around {$1200.00} and the third was about {$790.00} so total was just above {$2400.00} and again that was not counting the credits for the fraud charges. So I told her i needed to withdraw that. She went and got a manager and the manager came out to tell me that they could only withdraw these amounts they could not withdraw the credits I had been issued etc I said thats fine i just need this I have bills and XXXX to pay for. She said okay I need 2 forms of ID and just give me one moment and went to the back and was there a while before returning to the window with two other individuals and stated that these were branch managers and that they were very sorry but they could not withdraw the funds from the accounts because the accounts were restricted and all deposits, withdrawals, wire transers, direct deposits, automatic bill pays everything blocked and restricted until they were done investigating the fraud and after that they had 10 business days to make a decision and close the account after that itll be 10 business days before they issue and mail me a check for the remaining balances. I said I understand that but I just spoke to you guys on the phone and was told I was not allowed access to any of the funds credited while you investigated but that the balance that wasnt included, our hard earned money that we saved for bills etc was. They said were sorry theres nothing we can do. I asked if i could just have one of the account balances the lowest one or even part of it. We had no access to any of our money at all and I just needed something to use to feed my family, cover gas, diapers, and just basic necessities to survive. They said were sorry no. So I went home and tried to figure out what to do. By the time I got home it was after XXXX and there was nothing else i could do as they were closed. So the next XXXX first thing I called chase again to explain i went to the office and they refused to let me withdraw the money. She said oh well yeah thats their disgression. I said what can i do??? I need access to some of our money, I have bills my kids need food. She said well you can try a different branch and see what they say. I asked about the direct deposits that were supposed to hit soon ( my husbands paycheck on friday, child support for my daughter on saturday and my childs XXXX  benefits on the XXXX ) she said they will all get denied and sent back to the sender as well as any other autodraft bill payments checks etc. I said this is unreal this is our money. So i called a different branch explained the situation to see if i went there if they would let me withdraw the available funds. She took my info and looked it up and said yes absolutely. She said let me just verify with my back office and call you back. About 30 min later she called me back and said that they would not be able to give me access to the funds either as corporate had restricted all withdrawals of funds too. So I asked her if there was anything I could do she said no I just had to wait for them to mail me the check. \\nI called corporate back and told them what this branch said and she said then theres nothing we can do youre just going to have to wait for the check. I said no this is not okay or right, we have been good loyal customers for over 5 years, we did nothing wrong i reported legitimate fraud on our account and because of that you made the decision to restrict and close our account without warning or any notice at all and hold all our income and restrict any and all access to it and leaving us with absolutely no money. I said my husband is a XXXX XXXX XXXX veteran for the XXXX XXXX, I am a XXXX XXXX stay at home mom and we have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX children and youre doing this right before XXXX leaving us with no way to feed ourselves or provide the bare minimus necessities, no way to do anything for our children for XXXX and holding all the money we had to pay our rent to keep a roof over our kids heads and utilites to keep our kids warm, car payment car insurance nothing and are telling me we wont have our money any of it till probably end of XXXX? She said sorry theres nothing we can do the account is restriced and closed and youll just have to wait for the check ... \\n\\nSo I hung up and called my mom and told her what was going on and she said thats not possible so I called chase back and conferenced her in and she heard everything and when i asked there reason for this decision they said it was theyre perogative to end our banking relationship due to too many fraud reports I said I said but there werent too many there were 3 back to back. Your claims department is the one that kept turning them into multiple report. she said sorry nothing we can do. I asked if there was anyway i could get access to any of the available money that was not part of the claim and she said no, I said we have direct deposits hitting and its too late to change it. She said they will get denied and sent back to the sender. So youll have to call them after. I said what about our bills that were already scheduled to come out the day you t the account the auto pay for our car insurance, phone bill and car payment. She said those were already denied. \\nSo I hung up and called ssi and waited for 90+ minutes and explained the situations and requested to change the payment method. she said because of the holidays it was too late to fix the XX/XX/XXXX payment in time but she updated it for future payments. She said that chase would refuse the deposit and it would go back to them within 48 hours and as soon as it did they would issue and mail me a check and the latest i would have that would be the XXXX. I broke down I explained everything and said i have no way to pay our rent or bills or XXXX for my kids nothing. She then asked me if the bank that was doing all this was chase bank. I said yes! she said they're horrible they do stuff like this to people all the time. she apologized profusely and I thanked her and hung up and called my husband to let him know. He said he changed his payment record but he doesnt know if its in time and if this paycheck would go on his new payroll card or chase but his employer issued him an emergency loan of {$100.00} to his card just so we could survive. I hung up and called child support and they said it would take 10 days to process so not in time to fix the payment scheduled for saturday but that they would also issue and mail a check when they got it back. \\n\\nSo I went home and did the application to open a new checking with a new financial institution. I got to the verification and none of the identity verification questions were anything having to do with any of my information and they said they couldnt verify my identity so they were denying my account, so I went to log onto my social security account and all of my log in info was changed. So i checked XXXX XXXX and that was changed too so I started researching, and started realizing my identity might have been stolen so I started XXXX what to do. ( I have never had anything like this happen we're low income and dont apply for credit or anything so I dont really monitor my credit report ) thats when they XXXX  breach info and website came up and i clicked the link and entered in my info to see if I was one of the people affected during this breach and it turns out my husband and I both were. so i started putting freezes on my credit and fraud alerts. Then I get a knock and received a certified letter from the IRS stating I was delinquent on my XXXX taxes and owe {$1500.00} immediately. I had never gotten my XXXX taxes it was being audited and they were still researching it. I tried to call irs but  the government is shut down so is the transcript website and identity theft reporting site. plus holidays so wasnt anything more i could do. XXXX came and went still no access to our money or anything so I was waiting for the ssi check in the mail. Well on XXXX XXXX I got a check in the mail from chase for {$1300.00} that stated it was for the remaing balance of my account ( s ) it didnt list which accounts or statement nothing but it was enough to cover rent and keep our lights on. I called when I got home to see what account it was for what it included etc. 3 different department managers couldnt tell me. they said they see the check was issued and mailed but nothing and that I had to just wait till everything was finalized and closed and then call and see if theyll be issuing more checks etc. \\n\\nI got notices from the place i financed my car through, XXXX and our cellphone internet and cable company stating the autodraft was declined and we needed to make immediate payments to avoid termination. \\n\\nOn XXXX second I received 11 claim update/ decision letters from chase stating that they had completed their investigations on those claims and determined they were charged and processed correctly so they were reversing the temporary credits to my account and would be removing the money on the XXXX. \\n\\nI also received an email from XXXX XXXX stating they could not file my taxes for this year as a return with mine, my husbands and childrens social security numbers and information had already been filed. I contacted XXXX XXXX and upon investigation all of our identities and everything from drivers liscences, social security numbers everything had been stolen so i researched and found out the tax fraud and false returns etc started back in XXXX and thats why IRS said i owed money. I pulled my credit reports and everything was changed and we had 72 inquiries and 15 fraudulent accounts opened on top of all of our personal info changed. I went to the police station and filed a report I explained everything and he said that this was why our bank account had all that fraud on it and how they got our debit card info and was able to charge everything when i hadnt even used the cards.. \\n\\nI got the police report number, an affidavit from the DMV plus whatever other documentation I could get right now including the fraud reports from the credit reporting agencies and called chase with the updates and requested to appeal their decisions based on the new information. It wasnt just fraud transactions my identity and all info had been stolen. \\n\\nShe said \" They didnt see any errors with the transaction or attempts to authorize a different amount so we We denied your claims because the transactions occurred within your geographical area, youve previously done business with the merchants, the card was in your possession and there were no bad PIN tries, and you monitored your account on chase.com during the time the fraudulent transactions were occurring, but didnt report them to us immediately. We mailed you a check for {$1300.00} Were sorry for any misunderstanding that may have occurred concerning how and when you would have access to the money in your account. We show this check paid on XX/XX/XXXX. The remaining money in your account ending in XXXX, which includes a direct deposit for {$770.00} that we received on XX/XX/XXXX will be held until your claims have been finalized. Your claim for the {$30.00} XXXX transaction is still being researched and has a final resolution date of XX/XX/XXXX. Well inform you of our claim decision in writing once it has been finalized. The remaining money in your account ending in XXXX, which includes a direct deposit for {$770.00}, will be held until your claims have been finalized. If any money is owed to you, well mail you a check. '' I said \" You accepted the Direct deposit of my daughters federal social security XXXX payment of {$770.00} on XX/XX/XXXX even though you completely restricted our accounts on the XXXX and rejected all of our automatic bill payments and refused to let me withdraw any of the funds in our account???? Now youre telling me youre going to hold it along with the rest of our account balance till you finalize the dispute XXXX first and will issue and send me a check for the remaining balance in 10 business days??? So you fraudulenty accepted and essentially stole my disable daughters monthly federal ssi payment for XXXX and are not going to release it or give us access to it till end of XXXX early XXXX? '' She said well I dont know anything about that or why is was accepted etc. \\nI said I want that resolved now or I will be filing a charges. Also I want to dispute the decisions made on my fraud claims they were absolutely not authorized and fraudulent they were a result of identity theft. I have never done any business with those online merchants ever! I dont ever shop online nor do I or have I ever spent that much money in single purchases. I notified you immediately when I realized the fraud I was not monitoring my account either. Theyre online not in my area. I am submitting the police report and all the documentation of the fraud including my information that was compromised in the credit reporting agency fraud. Including access to all my financial and personal accounts. Also saw 6-8 fraudulent inquiries for credit requests to you guys on my credit report that i want to dispute as well and know why i wasnt notified when my info was accessed and it was requested. \\n\\nThis was tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, I have not gotten any response to my appeal/ challenging of their decision nor have they released my daughters federal payment or even responded as to how and why they accepted the deposit 10 days after completely restricting my account refusing bills and holding my income.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I started a XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX company a few years ago, and I travel around the country visiting XXXX. In XX/XX/2016, I received 5+ missed calls while I was in DC for work. I had used my computer at the XXXX I was staying at and at a few coffee shops. I call the number back and a woman from XXXX, Texas asked, \" Is this ( company name )? I received a notification from my bank ( XXXX XXXX ) that there is suspicious activity and someone is trying to transfer money into my account. '' Me \" Yes, this is ( company name ). Who is this? I am not trying to transfer money, but I will check with my bank and call you back. '' When I check my account initially, I did not see any unusual payments. So assumed it was some sort of mistake. But then a few days later, I noticed a XXXX in the amount of {$3700.00} which I did not recognize. I was thinking that maybe I was paying an invoice to someone. But when I saw who is was going to, I had no idea who this person was, and there were no open invoices that matched that amount in my accounts payable. I reported there was a XXXX transfer made that I had no idea about, and I did not approve. It was not done by any of the signers on the account. Funds are returned to my account. \\n\\nI go into a physical Chase location, filed a claim for it, and we closed the bank account. I was told that I would receive an email with an attachment that I need to fax in. \\nSo I wait and wait, and after a couple weeks go by, I call chase and ask them what the status of my claim is. They said that they did not receive my faxed form and so there was no progress on the claim. I explained that I was still waiting to receive it via email. By the way, I was still receiving other chase notifications, so I assumed that they had my email correct. They said they would email it in 1-2 business days. I asked him on the phone if he could email it to me while we were talking so that I can make sure that I got it. He said he could not do that but assured me that I would receive it in 24-48 hours.. \\nI get a voicemail from Chase. \" We need more information to continue our research of your claim. Please call us as soon as possible and refer to claim number # # # # # # # # #. '' I called the number in the email and explained what happened. They told me that my claim was closed because I never faxed in the form, and I responded that I never received the form. Then the Chase Agent sent me a link that allowed me to download the chase form to fax. ( Why couldn't they do that in the first place? ) I asked him if I can speak with someone from the team that is doing the investigation, and he replied that I can not and they will contact me and to look out for a phone number starting with XXXX or XXXX. I fill out form and drop it off at Chase to be faxed in. \\n\\nThey never called despite me requesting over and over that they call me. My Chase agent was amazing and tried so hard to help me get ahold of someone in the Investigations team, but she ended up just sitting on the phone for hours with no luck. I was told that they tried to call me once, and I didn't answer so they never called again. I have even looked through my phone since then and have not missed any calls from a phone number starting with those digits. I had made sure that if I saw any XXXX or XXXX numbers calling me, I would answer immediately, even if I was in a meeting or busy with something else. \\n\\nA few days later, I receive an email from Chase saying they \" issued a temporary credit in the amount of {$3700.00} for claim # # # # # # # #. You'll have full use of the temporary funds while we do our research. '' Thanks for calling us. Welcome to theChaseCustomer Claims Secure Document Exchange I  called the woman who called me at the beginning saying that she had received the money in her XXXX XXXX Account, no answer. \\n\\nI notice that chase has removed the funds from my account.I spend 50 minutes on the phone with Chase and am transferred from person to person. I keep asking for more information so that I can understand what exactly is going on with my account, and why the claim was dropped. After a very long and frustrating conversation, the guy on the phone tells me that the reason they denied the claim was because there was another XXXX transfer made from the same IP address on for {$80.00} that I did not claim. I told him that I did not make that transfer and asked him to file a claim for both. He said that they already closed the claim and he could not reopen it. After arguing for 20 more minutes, he finally agreed to file a new claim for both of the amounts. Why couldn't he have done this the first time I asked? I also asked him over and over for information on the IP addresses that the transactions were made from so that I could help prove my case. He refused. \\n\\nSo I email my Chase Agent. She called Chase again and made sure they reopened claim. I emailed Chase Agent multiple to ask if there are any updates on my claim because I haven't heard anything. She keeps checking for me. \\n\\nChase Agent emails me back, \" I just got off the phone with the claims department. They said that this claim is going to remain denied because they can not find proof that it was fraudulent. You are welcome to come back into the branch and we can try to reach out to the claims dept together or you can reach them XXXX 1. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. '' At this point, I have been talking to Chase for months, and I am super frustrated with everything in the Investigations and fraud department. It is very obvious that their goal is to not help you figure out what happened to your money. So I ask my Chase Agent if she can find outwhat EXACTLY they need from me to prove it was hacked.If they do not give me specifics I will ask my lawyer to step in. I also asked her if she could help me get information on the IP addresses that the transactions were made from so that I could help prove my case. From my standpoint, they are not even trying to help me they are just trying to throw my case out. It is also ridiculous that they have not even called me to talk to me about it and try to work with me to find a way to prove that this was fraud. I have NO information, and they are making it so incredibly difficult to get information about this fraud claim. \\n\\nSo I realize that I have a friend from college that works for Chase, so I go and visit him. He helps me take my case to their Escalations Dept. The Escalations Dept calls me and I tell her the whole story and she says she will call me back on Friday with updates ( 1 hr 20 minute conversation ) She says that she can not help me because the fraud dept is telling her that the IP address used for the 2 disputed transactions is still currently being used to monitor the account. At this point I am concerned that \" they are still monitoring my account. '' Again I asked for IP address information, but again, they refused. \\n\\nI call Chase again and the agent tells me that is NOT being used to monitor my account, which doesn't make sense because that was the very reason that I was told by the Escalations Dept that it was closed to begin with. \\n\\nAt this point, I realize that Chase is not going to help me at all. So I call the number of the woman who called me at the beginning. The person who answers claims to be an someone else and she doesn't know what I am talking about. Then she calls me back and says, \" I am ( her name ) and I do have your money. It was transferred in my account at XXXX XXXX and the bank put a hold on the account because I could not verify who was sending it. '' She said that she would return it to my account. But her story kept changing. First she had the full amount, then she said that she only had {$2500.00}. She told me that should were call her bank and have them return the money. \\n\\nStop in Branch to tell my agent the whole story. She brings her manager in too. I told them that I was going to get a lawyer involved, and they gave me the number to the Chase Executive Office Line. I call them and they say they will get back to me within 48 hours. \\n\\nThe gentleman from the Executive Office Line said that they could not prove that it was fraud because they were sent from my personal computer, the same one that I am currently using right now. So someone hacked into my computer without my knowledge and charged my account, and there is nothing they can do about it even though I DID NOT send or approve either of the 2 transactions.\n",

They bank is monitoring the account as in Complaint and unresolved Case File Number going back to XXXX Public Inquiry Unit dealing with the other unanswered and resolved complaints submitted to Chase bank. dealing with those facts. This day is XX/XX/XXXX I have contacted Chase bank in regards to sending me customer satisfaction emails in how am i going to pay for my overdrafts fees in the payments they are watching to add {$34.00} fee for insufficient fund. Now the insight of Chase bank i have accessed the forum to request the bank communicate if i am insufficient in allowing a payment i stopped to be paid and itemizing what Chase bank is going to pay. That i may request in depository rules other than FDIC my income that as a Insurance company can go to limit per day. As in that way i can request your named aka employees in requesting its he or she names pay my payroll per day of what i earn per month to include deductions before deposit. 1. Chase bank is not i to monitor or to inform the non payment of a Loan Company XXXX XXXX XXXX A chase bank returned payment on XX/XX/XXXX allocating i did not get a deposit. Consumer has 2 weeks to make a deposit before it can be returned. Chase bank informed the loan company XX/XX/XXXX that customer did not get a deposit and payment was returned insufficient. This is a violation of consumer privacy laws. Well. At that time Customer had no overdraft protection XX/XX/XXXX as a Chase bank asserted task but in XX/XX/XXXX Customer without giving Chase bank consent retains Overdraft protection. \\nI am only 1 person. for all this excise activity. Y Further XX/XX/XXXX a stop payment paid from customer account. Your employees maybe FDIC especially when they think they are consumers rights. In this forum my money is insured in another forum so on that note. I request Chase do not conflict with me to enforce rights on my payment they revoked titled : STOP Payment. 2. Chase bank respect the customer rights in NON overdraft protected until otherwise notified by customer in writing that she wants overdraft protection.. Well. About the stop payment. No payment from the Loan company was taken out of customers account in XXXX. In oversight of Chase bank revoking customers right in that the Fee {$25.00} XXXX when they allowed payment to post and pend payment that is a stop payment and add overdraft protection to the bills for that month to be paid. They do not make Financial decsions for customer and have and i herein in this complaint a request in notice :. The rights i retain i seek and request for other resolutions as i am tasking the issue of this complaint.. Further a request has been applied to the bank over the phone, then online message If Chase is going to enforce and disturb my rights in a stop payment fee of {$25.00} and to allow payment of the stop payment to clear I am not insufficient then The bank is in revocation of my right and to assert to notify me is harassment. How its my money that paid for it and as a request you should use your platform with online message available to notify or imply to customer of her overdraft in the account of insufficient but Chase paid and how i can make a deposit. Well i will make my deposit and apply the regulations to settle i notify you in this way as a civil request being defeated It would be advised the employees task a class of behavioral management in confusing their position to customers rights But since they are in custody and control of my right i believe we have a few regulated problems in request and my own personal input on screen of non overdraft protected. Chase bank says they can revoke may right and decide who they pay out of my account I have a lot of activity they state at another time is not visible but at that time was and lucky i learnt how to copy and paste, hold and keep documents before the task of it disappeared or is no loner available.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On XX/XX/XXXX there was a hail storm in XXXX XXXX South Dakota. I filed a claim with my insurance company. The insurance company looked at the damage on XXXX and gave me a check, that same day, made out to myself and Chase XXXX. I called Chase XXXX the same day and asked them how to proceed. I talked to XXXX and he rudely informed me of my options. One of my options was to come up with the remaining balance and pay off my vehicle. I later chose that option. On XX/XX/XXXX I went to my Credit Union and got a loan for the remaining balance of the car loan. My Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX, took the Insurance Check from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( check # XXXX ) for {$7100.00}, the cashiers check from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( check # XXXX ) for {$3700.00} and a letter she had typed up explaining that there were 2 checks enclosed to pay off my XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail from Chase telling me that the check I sent for {$7100.00} was not enough to pay off my vehicle and I needed to call them back to address the situation. I immediate called them back and explained that there were 2 checks in the envelope to pay off my car. The woman I talked to said there was not 2 checks in the envelope. she said the only thing in the envelope was the 1 check from XXXX. I told her that in fact there was 2 checks as well as a letter indicating what the 2 checks were for. She immediately became very rude and argumentative with me. I told her I knew for a fact what was in the envelope, because I was in the office with my loan officer when she put the 2 checks and the letter in the envelope, sealed it and set it for the mail. I expressed my concern that the check for {$3700.00} was floating around there somewhere and I would be held responsible for it. The woman told me I had to contact XXXX and put a stop payment on the cashiers check. In a state of frustration and anger I said I would do that. She said she would note it on my account that I was going to put the stop payment on that check. I immediately called XXXX and she said that you can not put a stop payment on a cashiers check and told me what I needed to do. I then called Chase back relayed this information. I got someone else on the phone the second time and I had to go thru the whole story again. The second person told me she only showed the check from XXXX being in the envelope. I asked her about the letter and she asked me to hold, she said she was looking through the notes. She then said in fact the letter was there with the check. I asked her what was going to happen if the Cashiers check magically appeared. She said she would note in my account what I was doing to get the problem fixed and also to hold the check for {$3700.00} if it appeared at Chase. After I did what I needed to do at the credit Union I called Chase and told them what I did. The 3rd Person I talked to told me that the insurance check had been mailed back to me. I told her that that was wrong and they were supposed to be on hold until everything was squared away. She insisted multiple times that it was mailed out. I asked her when it was mailed out. she put me on hold and came back on the line and said that in fact it had not been mailed out and she had it there in her possession. She said she was able to get it out of the mail room before it went out. She said she would get it taken care of for me. On XX/XX/XXXX I called chase again to get an update on what was going on. The 4th person I talked to said both checks were mailed back.She said that 1 of the checks was mailed to me and the other one was mailed to my ex husband at an address that we haven't lived at for, at the very least, 3 years. I asked her what she meant by both checks and she said the Insurance check and the cashiers check, so this means the cashiers check did in fact, magically appear. I immediately insisted I talked to a supervisor. I was transferred to XXXX XXXX at extension # XXXX at XXXX XXXX.. I explained the story in its entirety from the very first phone call back on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX started off the conversation in an argumentative manner. He told me many things. He said the conversation with Woman # 3 had never happened. I insisted it did and his reply was \" there was no note of it in the computer so the conversation didn't happen. He told me that XXXX didn't know what she was talking about and you can in fact stop payment on a cashiers check, he has been in the banking business for X amount of years and he knew what he was talking about and XXXX was wrong. He was telling me that the reason they did not apply the money to the account was because the Insurance estimate was not in with the envelope for the repairs. I told him that they didn't need the estimate to pay off the loan and he continuously insisted they did. when I challenged him as to why they needed the repair estimate, when I was, in fact, not getting my vehicle fixed, I was paying it off, he then changed his story and said I did not need the estimate. He confirmed one of the checks was sent to my ex husband at a different address than mine. I asked why it was not sent to me and he said it was because XXXX name was also on the check and that was the address they had on file for him. I told him I had sent Chase a letter informing them of our new address over a year ago and he confirmed that they did have the new address for me. I asked why they didn't have it changed for XXXX ( my now ex husband ), he said XXXX didn't send in a letter. I told him the letter stated it was to change the address for both of us. It included both of our names, date of births and account number and that XXXX and I both signed the letter. He then went quite for a brief moment and avoided answering the question. I asked when the checks were mailed out. He said the Insurance check was mailed out to me on XXXX and the cashiers check was sent to XXXX, at the wrong address, on XXXX. I later received a letter dated XXXX that the check was mailed back to me on XXXX and not XXXX. I also expressed my concerns about having a late payment as well as my deep concerns of this affecting my credit. I had not made my XXXX payment because I was under the impression that my car was paid off from the transaction taking place back on XXXX and then the fact that I was in constant contact with Chase about this whole situation. I also knew if I went ahead and made my XXXX payment it would adjust my payoff balance in which I had already sent the exact amount of money for. I asked if they were going to wave any late payments and/or penalties because of this being their error. He said in fact no they would not cover those. It was my responsibility to pay those. I argued this point and then he said they \" might '' cover it if it's a couple bucks, but he would have to look into that. I did later receive the insurance check from Chase in the mail. I knew that I would not receive the Cashiers check because the Post Office only forwards mail for 1 year, I only had to hope the current resident of the apartment did the right thing and would send it back to Chase. On XXXX I went back to the Credit Union with the Insurance check and we were going to send it, a new cashiers check and letter to Chase. At some point and time somehow Chase got the Cashiers check back in their possession and applied it to my account on XXXX. XXXX and I called Chase and Talked to XXXX at extension XXXX at XXXX XXXX. because the Insurance check was stamped for deposit but there was another stamp over the deposit stamp making it invalid and not depositable. XXXX had to check with her supervisor to find out if it was ok to send that check back or if we needed to get a new check from XXXX. she called XXXX back a day or two later and told her it was ok to send the original check to them. XXXX did send the original insurance check back to Chase for payment in full. I called every day and frequently twice a day to confirm that they had received the check and my car had in fact finally been paid off. Finally on Tuesday XXXX when I called, the recording indicated my car was paid off. \\n\\nThe Companies involved are as follows : Chase XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, South Dakota XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Florida XXXX XXXX\n",

contacted XXXX XXXX ( insurance provider ). They told me I could pull out anything wet. I pulled out clothing, towels, ruined items, furniture, etc. \\nThey sent an adjuster. At his visit he said that he was approving me for an {$8000.00} building check to get started. And to go ahead and contact my mortgage company, because they would need to endorse it as well. He also told me that I could pull out anything wet. He informed me that I did not have to have a license contractor to do work in the house. I could choose who I wanted or do it myself. \\nI immediately called Chase, told them I flooded, have a check coming and asked what did I need to do.

She said ( the second time I have been told this ) that the notes say the inspection was cancelled because they tried to contact me. Thats what Ive been told both times. She said that the reason was probably because I still didnt have a licensed contractor, even though it was noted otherwise. I never had any calls from inspectors or messages even though they said I had at least 6 calls concerning. I asked to speak with a supervisor, got XXXX XXXX, resolution specialist/account supervisor. Needed a license and the request was never approved. She said you can request anything you want, doesnt mean youre going to get it. Thats the point of a request.

XX/XX/XXXX I had requested a check for him from chase. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Talked to XXXX at XXXX. Said I needed a contractors license or things could be made simpler if I switch to self-contractor. I said I had never heard that was possible, and first time I knew it was an option. She said it was possible if I had a current mortgage with them. Though if she switched me over to self-contracting, that I couldnt use the insurance check site and had to pay all out of pocket first then get submitted when totally done. I said I dont feel comfortable switching, I need to speak with my lawyer on what I should do because a ) I need an electronic record of everything and self-contracting relies on faxing and mail b ) how do I can I be ensured the money will come to me at the end?

She also said the notes said XXXX XXXX had been called but no answer on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Chase called me to inform me that they cancelled my check request to pay XXXX XXXX {$6500.00} since I had submitted a receipt that said paid. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Flooring laid XX/XX/XXXX Cabinets installed. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Floors to be sealed.\n",

              "      <td>I am writing you to file a complaint about an unresolved issue with my credit card chase and their benefit and travel departments. This has been my second travel related credit issue with chase. My first experience with chase was also about a credit that they were supposed to process. Chase was either unresponsive or slow. I finally ended up contacting the airlines directly and got a much quicker response and resolution from them. \\n\\nMy more recent issue with Chase has been my most stressful and frustrating experience when dealing with any credit card company or for that matter any other company that offers products or services. I am a Chase Sapphire card holder who has been using the card regularly for purchases amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars every month. I have an excellent payment history with most of the bills paid in full every month. \\n\\n\\nIn XXXX  of 2019, I bought my XXXX airline ticket for an overseas trip through Chase using my accumulated Chase points. My father passed away overseas a week before my trip. I had to cancel my original trip and leave immediately so I called chase to cancel my ticket. Despite, under a lot of stress and in grief, I had to be on the phone with them for hours. I was put on long holds, transferred to different departments and still did not receive a definitive answer about cancelation of my trip and credit to my account. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the last customer representative that I spoke with that night, they had to send an email to a different department and that I could follow up with them the following week by Tuesday or Wednesday as they would have processed my cancelation by then. Unfortunately, It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to be calling from overseas and be on the phone with the credit card company for hours. I had to authorize my husband to follow up on my behalf the following week before his upcoming trip overseas as he had to leave on XX/XX/XXXX, which was our original plan. \\n\\n\\nMy husband called them few times and went through the same process of being on the phone for hours either being on hold or being transferred to different departments. He spoke with the main customer service, the benefits and the chase travel. Initially, a representative advised him to contact XXXX  directly to cancel my ticket. Finally, after further research, the same representative that he spoke to in the benefit department told him that we should expect to receive a credit because of the death in the family, The representative assigned us a case number and told my husband that Chase would get the refund from XXXX on our behalf. According to him, all we needed was a death certificate. Since we were both expected to be out of the country for few weeks, the representative told my husband that the credit could be processed anytime upon our return or soon after the Chase received the death certificate from us. \\n\\nIn XXXX, while still overseas, I received an e-mail on XXXX, XXXX from XXXX in Chase travel who was following up with the death certificate. I e-mailed Chase travel department the scanned copy of the death certificate as soon as it became available to me. I even e-mailed them a translation of the death certificate which was neither required by Chase or XXXX. I sent it to XXXX who had contacted me on XXXX, XXXX by responding to her e-mail from XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded it again to her to make sure that they received it. For personal and family reasons, I ended up staying a little longer than expected and retuned to the United States on XXXX. There was still no acknowledgment from XXXX or anyone from Chase Travel or any other department acknowledging the receipt of my e-mail from XXXX or any other update. Soon after my return, I had to send the travel department my father 's death certificate for the third time and even tried to follow up with a phone call. I also tried to send them an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX, expressing my disappointment and requesting an update. I also tried to correspond with Chase customer service and Chase travel through my online chase account. \\n\\nChase travel finally responded with an acknowledgement through an e-mail that they had received and located the death certificate that I had sent them. The e-mail was from XXXX, one of the Travel consultant supervisor for chase travel. According to her, they had forwarded the death certificate to XXXX. She apologized for my experience with them and also asked me to disregard any other emails from them requesting documentation. During this whole ordeal with Chase, I had contacted XXXX numerous times and spoke to different representatives. According to XXXX, In order for Chase to process my credit, they didn't need to forward the death certificate to XXXX. \\n\\nIn one of my initials calls to Chase after my return to the United States, I found out that the case number / reference number assigned to us and given to my husband by the by chase benefits department in XXXX could not be used as a reference because I was told that it did not exist in their system. In XXXX and XXXX, I spoke to several people and few supervisors hoping that they could resolve my issue. Customer service agents who seemed willing to help did not have the authority to resolve my issue as there was no outcome and I ended up wasting several hours without any resolution in sight. \\n\\nThere was one supervisor in Chase travel department, which was probably being managed by XXXX, named XXXX, whom I ended up speaking with twice. During our brief conversation, She flatly refused to help me or answer any questions. She had the most condescending attitude that I have ever experienced from an agent affiliated with any company. She refused to give me an update or call XXXX. She refused to transfer me to her manager or anyone that could assist me. To top it all, she told me I needed a proof that I was related to the deceased which was contrary to what I had been told up till that point that all I needed was a death certificate. I called XXXX and according to them, a proof of relationship was not necessary or required. XXXX told me that it was their policy that all that was needed was a death certificate and Chase should have processed my credit as soon as they received it. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I emailed and I called Chase few times and each time I was promised that a supervisor would get back to me which never happened. One of the last representatives that that I spoke with was on XXXX, XXXX, who was from Chase benefits department. To my utter shock and surprise, he told me that they didn't have any type of claim for me on file. I was beyond hope at that point. He then transferred me once again to their travel department. The representative there told me that they were still waiting to hear from XXXX. I requested to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would be two hours before I could speak with one. She promised that a supervisor would call me back but as always, I never heard from anyone. \\n\\nAfter several weeks on the phone with Chase and after speaking to XXXX multiple times who repeatedly told me that the delay was from Chase, I finally decided that I would wait and see if the issue would be resolved. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Chase has still not processed my credit and followed up or called back in response to any of my previous phone calls even when they promised that I would receive a phone call. \\n\\nI have finally decided that I am going to file a formal complaint with every private, state and federal consumer protection agency or organization. I would share my experience on any relevant online or offline forums available to me. I have been a great customer. I may have been frustrated with my experience but have always been respectful in my communications with Chase or its representatives. I have been managing my credit responsibly over the years, had several premium credit card offers as I had met their criteria to apply for their cards with similar benefits as Chase Sapphire. I decided to go with Chase and was hopeful that I would take advantage of their travel benefits. I spent thousands of dollars using my Chase card even though some of my other cards also offered attractive benefits. \\n\\nAs stated earlier, I fulfilled my obligation of using credit responsibly and of paying my bills. Chase on the other hand, failed to issue me a credit and fulfill its promise. A timely credit, under the circumstances, was my right. It was according to and within the rules set by both the Chase and XXXX Airlines. Unfortunately, I was never able to utilize the points that I had accumulated. A credit card company at the very least should treat every customer with respect, follow their own rules, keep their promises and follow up with their customers and if required and within the rules, be its customer 's adovocate on his or her behalf when dealing with third parties. I feel that Chase fell short of these basic standards and expectations. It with deep regret that I have to reconsider my business relationship with them. It is a shame that a well known company like Chase offering a premium card such as, Chase Sapphire and charging a $ XXXX yearly membership fee for it, would have such a poor service. It is either a case of extreme mismanagement by chase or a system deliberately designed in such a way that it only benefits the company at the expense of its customers.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Early in XXXX I became the XXXX XXXX of the US office of a XXXX company. The U.S. office of the company was incorporated in Delaware as a separate entity. There is a sole owner who also owned the XXXX based entity. \\nOur bank was Chase, and XXXX XXXX our bank contact, based on a relationship with prior foreign company I had been running at the same location with the same infrastructure and bookkeeper. XXXX relationship with Mr. XXXX dated from from XXXX or XXXX. The Chase relationship dated from XXXX. \\n\\nIn early XXXX of XXXX I asked XXXX XXXX about a small line of credit. The company produced TV commercial and in production oftentimes equipment and locations need to be paid in advance, or require deposits. In addition there is travel. I had been using my own ( personal ) credit card. Given XXXX was slow in paying us money owed, I was getting concerned. \\n\\nXXXX called me a few days later and said he had a better solution and put me in touch with XXXX XXXX, at the bank, to open a company credit card. He assured me it would be set up as a corporate card and I would have no liability. I reiterated I was doing this as I was using my own card and did not want any liability. \\nThe card application was made on-line during a phone call with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX initiated the call.. After we spoke, he transferred me to XXXX XXXX. She guided me through the process. I specifically said to her I did not want the card if I would be liable if something happened with the company. I explained that I knew of instances where employee had cards in their names and were held liable. She clearly told me I was covered in the event of any kind of default. She told me the company was responsible and I was \" protected '' ( her word ) On that same call XXXX guided me through the on-line application. I never signed anything. The official card date of issue is XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI left XXXX at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and closed the office for them, although the company was kept open. The part time bookkeeper stayed on. The XXXX company declared insolvency in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX in the US has never actually closed. The owner stopped responding to anything in XXXX. The XXXX Chase Bank account remains open with a small balance. \\n\\nDuring the last week XXXX of XXXX, when I closed the physical office of XXXX XXXX in the US. Everything was given to the part time bookkeeper who was the one that handled all the financial affairs and bank business. She was known to XXXX XXXX and had interacted on a regular basis. She was given the checkbook and the card, and she had all current records. All further Chase business should be would be forwarded to her P.O. box. The monthly statements had always gone to the company address. \\n\\nThe day I closed the office I went up to my Chase branch and spoke to my banking contact XXXX XXXX. I told him I had left and the physical office was closed. I explained that the bookkeeper was taking over. I informed him I was no longer a signatory on checks and she had the card in her possession. \\nSome time in XXXX I contacted XXXX on a personal banking matter and when my leaving was referenced he claimed he had no idea and denied I ever came to see him. Not sure why. Perhaps he genuinely forgot. I asked him if the card needed to be closed. But he was rather argumentative. He said he would take care of it. He contacted XXXX XXXX. That resulted in the following email exchange that you will see below. \\n\\nXXXX, XXXX XXXX had left XXXX XXXX this past XXXX. Please advise on having him removed from these business accounts. Bill can be reached at XXXX. Thank you. \\nRegards, XXXX XXXX At that point XXXX asked me for the book keeper 's phone number which I supplied to her. That was the extent of her correspondence. The card was kept open and the bank continued to do business with the corporate entity. I heard nothing back from that point on. There was nothing from her about any liability or action regarding the card. The bank never contacted me, or sent me bills or notices, ( despite their claim to the contrary in the attached XX/XX/XXXX letter to my attorney ). Nor was I informed if the account was closed or kept open, or closed. They had a home address for me, and a telephone number. XXXX XXXX did not contact me after that. As noted, she knew I was gone, and card was left open and the bank continued on doing business with the company, and payments were ongoing for a time after that. \\n\\nThe monthly payments continued to be made by the company and were accepted by the bank. The last one was as of XX/XX/XXXX. At some point the XXXX based owner walked way from his obligations and it appears the card was rendered inactive. ( When I was able to retrieve all the records for the account there was nothing between that XXXX statement and one issued XX/XX/XXXX. ) However the company was never closed. And as of earlier this year there is still a bank account with a balance. However the account has been frozen. \\n\\nMost importantly that correspondence from XXXX XXXX was the last I heard from Chase or anyone about he account, until Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. This was over two years after leaving the company. I received the attached notice, mailed to my home, from XXXX XXXX. I had never received a bill or notice at my home address. \\n\\nI contacted XXXX XXXX by email about it. Her email response : I have looked into the credit card ending in XXXX This credit card is issued in the business name, with your self as personal guarantor. That is why I believe you are getting the communication from XXXX XXXX. The last transaction on the card ( purchase transaction ) is from XX/XX/XXXX, but there were payments made each month until XX/XX/XXXX at which time the payments stopped and a late fee has been charged plus the interested each month. \\n\\n( E-mails are attached ) I further asked her about any signature and a closing date. Her response : I am looking into a documentthere may not be one, as one wasnt needed in XXXX Opened XX/XX/XXXX, there is no closed date listedit is in charged off status She also told me statements were available on line. They were not. I called the bank 3 times and they promised statements within 10 days at my home address. They never came. I was finally able to get them printed at a branch. \\n\\nThe notices continued with XXXX offering to reduce the amount of {$29000.00} to around {$11000.00} and a proposed payment plan. I hired legal representation. My attorney then contacted XXXX and said all correspondence should go to him. He explained our stance that I am not liable and this is corporate debt, and outlined the reasons. At that point XXXX returned the debt to Chase. Chase then responded to my lawyer in correspondence received XX/XX/XXXX. ( Attached ). A summation from my lawyer : Chase finally responded. They claim you are responsible personally because you applied in your name with your SSN. They attached a form showing the information. They also attached an Agreement that says, in its section headed Legal Responsibility that says that the person who applied for the account and gave his/her SSN is responsible. \\nChase closes by pointing out that they may close out the account if it is not paid and then report the debt as forgiven,,, the IRS will expect you to pay income taxes on the amount forgiven, {$29000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThey further claimed in the attached document that \" We kept sending monthly statements to XXXX XXXX XXXX until the account charged off on or about XX/XX/XXXX. '' This is not true. \\n\\nIn referencing my liability they used my home address in XXXX on XXXX. I never received a bill or notice there during the entire time the account was opened and closed. That address was only used by the collection agency. And my last communication was in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my attorney sent a letter to the XXXX owner notifying him of the debt. ( Attached ). He has not responded, On XX/XX/XXXX my lawyer called the bank at the number provided on the XX/XX/XXXX correspondence that was sent by the bank after XXXX XXXX returned the debt to the bank. He asked that the IRS debt forgiveness be assigned to XXXX and not me. And said if paid a small amount just to end this and so as not to keep paying him was that possible. They said no to both. They advised him to write to a chase address in Delaware. My Lawyer sent a letter to Chase at the Delaware Address ( attached ) on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. In early XXXX we had not heard from the Delaware office. They finally returned a call to my lawyer on XX/XX/XXXX. The person from Chase said they had not read the letter and further stated he had been told the XX/XX/XXXX letter was valid. My lawyer responded that the letter raised specific questions and we wanted answers to those questions. The representative said he would report back the comments. We have yet to hear back. \\n\\nIn addition to the IRS, this has also been reported to the major credit bureaus. My credit record was excellent until this appeared.</td>\n",

              "      <td>I received an offer from Chase XXXX Visa promising a companion airline pass XXXX bonus points for opening a Chase XXXX Visa card. I applied for the card online in XX/XX/XXXX providing my current email address, phone number and address. I was approved. In XXXX I requested paperless billing statements/correspondence and assumed that my current contact information provided at time of approval would be utilized by Chase for the XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nHaving previous Chase credit card products I was able to log into my online account and setup automatic bill payment for my account. I used my card as needed to earn the companion pass and bonus points and assumed the auto payments were being made from my checking account as I viewed line items that had Chase in the description and as I was not receiving paper statements/emails or phone calls from Chase regarding my XXXX account. \\n\\nIn reviewing my checking account statement in XXXX and realizing the that the Chase line item was actually an auto payment for one of my husbands credit cards and was not in fact for the XXXX Visa card I reached out to Chase XXXX Visa immediately. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to the customer service phone number listed on the back of my card ( Payments are due on the XXXX of the month ) to learn that I was 34 days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take 1-2 business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect. \\n\\nAdditionally, I learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information I had provided at the time of application. \\n\\nI made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance, requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future. \\n\\nThey made notation in the account of the challenge, reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late payment would not be reported to the credit bureau due to the banking error. Also confirmed that I had met the required spend to earn the bonus and given the banking error, reversal of late charges, payment in full and notation that I would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which I HAVE received. This reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end. \\n\\nAll subsequent payments have been made on time and as of XX/XX/XXXX the account has a {$12.00} balance due to charges made after payment in full. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX alert service that I subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from XXXX to XXXX. I opened the XXXX file which stated a late payment was reported by Chase for XXXX. I filed a dispute and in XXXX received an email from XXXX  stating the dispute had been resolved. Upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed. \\n\\nI contacted Chase XXXX Visa, explained the negative reporting, the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges. They stated that the \" Credit Bureau Unit '' was not currently open and requested I call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information. \\n\\nI followed the advice and spoke with XXXX, CBU specialist in the XXXX, MO call center. After a long period of discussion XXXX informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau. \\n\\nAfter requesting all notation on my file he advised I send a fax to the \" Business Office '' at ( XXXX ) XXXX but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that I could send the request to. \\n\\nI asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to XXXX customer service. \\n\\nIn speaking with XXXX in customer service I believed that I was still speaking to the Credit Bureau department. I recalled all events, she confirmed the notation in the account. Additionally, I advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on XX/XX/XXXX my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all Chase accounts. I was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account I received a screen that stated that I needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbers/email that were pre-populated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information. I had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once I was able to gain access into the account I confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the DEFAULT contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information. \\n\\nI explained to her that when I tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account. She assisted with updating on her end, had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information. \\n\\nGiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup I asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting. At this point SHE ADVISED ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE CREDIT BUREAU DEPARTMENT and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done. I explained that I had already spoken with XXXX in that department and that I was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her. She stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to 5 days to provide a call back. \\n\\nShe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named XXXX, explained the situation and XXXX told her that there \" was nothing that he could do to assist ''. \\n\\nI have never been late with a payment across all accounts. I have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with JP Morgan Chase/XXXX. As a result of Chase/XXXX XXXX it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment &amp; provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that I will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from \" Outstanding '' to \" Good '' and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered. \\n\\nI am reaching out to you in hopes that you will be able to 1 ) Assist with restoring my credit due to banking/IT error on the part of the credit card issuer 2 ) By sharing my story prevent another person from being lured into getting a credit card from Chase and have to deal with the same challenges I have faced.</td>\n",

United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 731 ( 1931 ) ; see also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 188 ( 1824 ). Normal meaning may of course include an idiomatic meaning, but it excludes secret or technical meanings that would not have been known to ordinary citizens in the founding generation. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 ( 2008 ).\\n\\nOBLIGATIONS : In common language, the state of California articulates the predicate for an obligation by stating the following : CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE CCP PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS ( Preliminary Provisions enacted 1872. ) 26. Section Twenty-Six. An obligation is a legal duty, by which one person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing, and arises from : One- Contract ; or Two- Operation of law.\\n\\n( Amended by Code Amendments 1873 -74, Ch. 383 ) COMMON LANGUAGE : The State of  California clarifies the meaning of the terms Contract or by Operation of Law with the following : CIVIL CODE CIV DIVISION 3.

My wife shared with Ms. XXXX that she believed my Credit Score should be in the range of 700 720. \\n2. We disclosed that we did NOT want to take any cash out of the property.\\n\\n3. We also shared with her that we would be paying out of pocket the refinancing cost so please do not wrap any cost into the Loan. \\n4. We asked how long is Chases Refinance process and Ms. XXXX share 45 to 60 days. We asked whether or not if she could complete the process in 30 days since we would not be taking any cash out. She committed to completing the process in 30 days if we were able to forward all of the documents on the list she provided back to her on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. We committed to going home and forwarding to her all of the documents requested on Saturday, XXXX XXXX. \\n5.

Thank you and have a blessed day. Thank you for choosing Chase! \\nWhen we did not her from Ms. XXXX on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, my wife called her late Tuesday afternoon. XXXX represented that she never received the documents even though here email reply when documents were sent stated the above message. \\nMy wife asked XXXX to look into her Spam/Junk Box.

Our contact information is below. Thank you for choosing Chase. \\n\\n\\nWHAT IS DECEPTION This communication portends several issues from my perspective ; first there is a matter of dubious candor as articulated in the plain language of California CIV 1709 1710, which articulate the following : CIVIL CODE-CIV DIVISION 3. OBLIGATIONS [ 1427 -3272.9 ] ( Heading of Division 3 amended by Stats. 1988. Ch. 160, Sec 14 ) Part 3. OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY LAW [ 1708 1725 ] ( Part 3 enacted 1872. ) 1709. One, who willfully deceives  another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers. \\n1710. A deceit, within the meaning of the last section, is either : 1. The suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true ; 2. The assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true ; 3. The suppression of a fact, by one who is bound to disclose it, or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact ; or, 4. A promise, made without any intention of performing it.\\n\\n( enacted 1872 ) BACK AND FORTH BANTERING : Emails dispersed from myself to Ms. XXXX XXXX and my wife to Ms. XXXX XXXX, [ cc and her supervisor, Mr. XXXX XXXX eventually, Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX ] from the period of XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX indicate a pattern of deception enumerated in CIV 1710 ( 1 4 ) and may concurrently be in contravention of GOV 12927 ( c ) ( 1 ), which articulates the following narrative in part : GOVERNMENT CODE - GOV TLE 2. GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [ 8000 - 22980 ] ( Title 2 enacted by Stats. 1943, Ch. 134. ) DIVISION 3. EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT [ 11000 - 15986 ] ( Division 3 added by Stats. 1945, Ch. 111. ) PART 2.8.

As used in this part in connection with housing accommodations, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context : ( c ) ( 1 ) Discrimination *** includes provision  of inferior terms, conditions, privileges, facilities, or services in connection with those housing accommodations. \\n\\n( d ) Housing accommodation means any building, structure, or portion thereof that is occupied as, or intended for occupancy as, a residence by XXXX or more families and any vacant land that is offered for sale or lease for the construction thereon of any building, structure, or portion thereof intended to be so occupied. \\n\\n( f ) Person includes all individuals and entities that are described in Section 3602 ( d ) of Title 42 of the United States Code, and in the definition of owner in subdivision ( e ) of this section, and all institutional third parties, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.\\n\\n( g ) Aggrieved person includes any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that the person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.\\n\\n( h ) Real estate-related transactions include any of the following : ( 1 ) The making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance that is for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling, or that is secured by residential real estate.\\n\\n( 2 ) The selling, brokering, or appraising of residential real property.\\n\\n15 U.S. Code 1639. Requirements for certain mortgages : ( a ) Disclosures ( 1 ) Specific disclosures in addition to other disclosures required under this subchapter, for each mortgage referred to in section 1602 ( aa ) [ 1 ] of this title, the creditor shall provide the following disclosures in conspicuous type size : ( A ) You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application.\\n\\n( o ) Affiliate defined for purposes of this section ; the term affiliate has the same meaning as in section 1841 ( k ) of title 12.\\n\\n( 1 ) Exemptions the Bureau may, by regulation or order, exempt specific mortgage products or categories of mortgages from any or all of the prohibitions specified in subsections ( c ) through ( i ), if the Bureau finds that the exemption ( A ) is in the interest of the borrowing public ; and ( B ) will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen home ownership and equity protection.\\n\\n( 2 ) Prohibitions : The Bureau, by regulation or order, shall prohibit acts or practices in connection with ( A ) mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of this section ; and ( B ) refinancing of mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be associated with abusive lending practices, or that are otherwise not in the interest of the borrower.\\n\\nThe sole and exclusive disclaimer made by the agents of Chase, which appears to countervails 15 U.S. C. 1639 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) is the following statement : Ms. XXXX as an Agent for JP Morgan Chase lied when she stated to me and my wife that : 1. JP Morgan Chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering Loan Terms and Interest Rate to me and my wife. \\n\\n2. She lied when she presented to me and my wife that JP Morgan Chase selection of the lowest Fico Score was due to Chases Guideline ( s ) /Policy. \\n\\n3. When we asked for a copy of Chases Guidelines, she and her Manager, Mr. XXXX lied when they stated that JP Morgan Chase Guidelines are Internal documents and are not given out. \\n\\n4. When Ms. XXXX tried to cover Ms. XXXX lie. XXXX XXXX instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written Quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because Chase does meet their Competitors Pricing and Interest Rate. However, when we submitted a written Quote from a competitor, Mr. XXXX in support of Ms. XXXX stated in an email communication that Chase DOES NOT meet competitors pricing and since we had NOT provided a {$500.00} Good Faith Fee and did not submit all documentation [ which we did ] we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the XXXX Fico Score and Pricing or cancel the process. \\n\\n5. Ms. XXXX email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors Pricing/Interest Rate using a XXXX Fico Score as Ms. XXXX instructed us to do with the words, where did you get this from. Never addressing that fact that the Interest Rate quoted was 3.625 % and we did what she asked of us.\\n\\n6. Ms. XXXX was asked NOT to load ANY of the cost into the Loan. She did it anyway and when asked several times to update the Loan Amount she did not complete that task until Friday, XXXX XXXX evening when she was on her way out the door for the week. \\n\\n7. Ms. XXXX lied when she sent me the initial MyHomeChase email to login and/or create login credentials in order to begin the process. Ms. XXXX FAILED to provide me with the Loan Application Number. When my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the 24 hours account creation expired, Ms. XXXX stated that she did not provide the Loan Application Number because she wanted me to give her a call when I discovered that I could not move forward. \\n\\n8. It was during my wife phone conference with Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX that he confirmed the lies that Ms. XXXX represented on behalf of Chase. It was disclosed that Chase DOES uses the Middle Fico Score not the lowest. It was also disclosed that Chase did not have any such Guideline ( s ) /Policy of using the lowest Fico Score as previously represented to us by Ms. XXXX XXXX It was disclosed that Ms. XXXX did NOT 10 years of experience as a Home Loan Advisor with Chase. Mr. XXXX further confirmed that Ms. XXXX has worked for Chase for several years as a Teller along with assisting other Loan Advisors. I believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that Ms. XXXX has worked on ALONE. \\n\\nMr. XXXX in Good Faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to Chases XXXX location, but my wife decided to give Ms. XXXX the benefit-of-the doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process. \\nI believe Mr. XXXX XXXX stated to my wife that he had a conversation with Ms. XXXX regarding the issues. \\n\\nHowever, it was a BIG MISTAKE to leave Ms. XXXX in place. It also appears that the conversation that Mr. XXXX had with Ms. XXXX DID NOT WORK! \\nThroughout Friday, XX/XX/XXXX late afternoon Ms. XXXX sent me several misleading emails informing me that my Loan Documents were ready for me to login to MyHomeChase to complete the loan application process and to paid the {$500.00} Good Faith Fee. \\n\\nI emailed her to alert her that the documents had NOT been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents. She then sent me another email late Friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents. I waited for I believe 2 hours and I emailed her back to share with her that I had not received the separate email. Later in the afternoon/early evening my wife placed a call to her. Her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nShortly, after that the separate email arrived. I login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the OLD documents. I email Ms. XXXX back with both Mr. XXXX &amp; Mr. XXXX on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting Ms. XXXX with hanging the revised documents. Neither Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX responded. \\n\\nHowever, Ms. XXXX did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on Monday and that the only thing she did was to change the Loan Amount. \\nShe went on to let me know that Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nIn conclusion, as far as I am concerned ALL of the above behavior is a clear representation of Unfair Business Practices and Fraudulent Business Practices which my last email on Friday, XXXX XXXX that Mr. XXXX responded back to and forward to his Executive Office clearly reflects my DISDAINED for being subjected to [ 2 Trusted Agents of JP Morgan Chase ], Ms. XXXX and Mr. XXXX Fraudulent and Unlawful Conduct.</td>\n",

              "      <td>My husband and I have been loyal chase customers for over 5 years with no issues at all until starting in mid XXXX I noticed there were alot of unauthorized transactions on my husband and Is account all online purchases, as well as my other two checking accounts ( again all from online purchases ) so I called chase to report the charges and explained they would investigate file reports ( they had to file 3 reports one for each account because they said they couldnt just combine them into one report. ) They asked me if i had ever done business with any of the merchants before and I said no not online. They asked if i had given any one my card number and allowed them to use my card online again i said no. They said okay thank you and closed out these debit cards and would send me new one and i should see a temporary credit on my account for these transactions while they investigated I said great thank you so much. So I got online and printed off all the transactions for my accounts for the last three months and started going thru them and matching them with my receipts. I noticed I had missed some transactions ( seriously there were so many transactions ) and so I called chase bank and explained and asked if i could get these added to the reports they stated no they couldnt do that they had to open 3 more fraud reports. I said ok went thru everything again and again they said I would see credit in the next 12 hours. Ok awesome, So the new cards arrive I activate them and over the next 24/48 hours I use them sparingly just things like gas groceries etc. again nothing online or over {$100.00}. Well I log back on to check my accounts and notice all our accounts were drained or negative. So i start looking at the accounts thinking maybe the credits hadn't hit or they were still processing etc. Nope there was more fraud this time on all 3 of my brand new debit cards. I was shocked I called chase again and asked if this was normal what was going on etc etc. I was told its normal around this time of year with the holdidays etc. So I started new reports but this time was told I not only had to open seperate ones for each account but now also for each vendor. So i said ok and they said the same thing ok theyd investigate close out my cards/ send me new ones and issue credits. This time ( when I received my new cards about a week later ) and after I had called and activated them I only put one of them in my wallet the other two I put in our safe. I checked our accounts and saw the credits and went thru and compared the credits to the fraudulent charges I had reported I noticed that over 10 of the transactions I reported as fraudulent chase had accidentally missed. So again I called and let them know and again even tho i had already reported them they had to start new reports etc. okay again no big deal. I had this 2nd set of new debit cards in hand and activated less than 48 hours and I log on to see if they had reported the rest of the transactions and low and behold more fraud. Even on the cards that were completely untouched and in my safe!!! On the other one I had made a total of two purchases with one for {$6.00} at the pharmacy for my XXXX XXXX daughter and the other one for {$25.00} on gas. I was completely dumbfounded. So I immediately called chase again this was XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX XXXX and reported the charges and asked what I could do could I close the accounts and open new ones with new bank account numbers? I had already changed my password on my chase account. They said no they couldn't do that till all these reports had been investigated. I said okay and filed the new reports and just decided I wouldn't even activate them this time I would just go into chase and pull off cash and use that till all this gets worked out. They again said no problem they would then close the cards send new ones etc. I asked them what I could do and how this could be happening they just said they didn't know but fraud happens alot this time of year. I said okay thank you etc. At about XXXX that XXXX   I went to log on to my chase account to check and make sure they got everything and it wouldnt let me log into my account it said to call chase for further info and help. So I call chase and they informed me that they had restricted and closing all my accounts due to a large number of fraud complaints. I told them that was them I only had 3 fraud reports they were the ones that turned each transaction into a seperate claim. I asked how I was going to get access to our money all of our money was in those accounts ( bills, my kids XXXX, everything I wan na say not even including the fraud there was at least {$2000.00} between the accounts plus my husbands paycheck was getting direct deposited friday and my daughters child support and social security XXXX. They said that I could go into a branch and pull off the funds but that the account was restricted and all deposits and transactions would be denied/ blocked and returned. They said the account would stay restricted for the next 10 business days while they finished investigating the claims and that when they were done they would close the accounts and the remaining balances would be sent to us by check 10 business days after that ( so probably by mid XXXX because of the holidays ) I said I would be going to the branch now and withdrawing the funds. I had to we needed that money we had rent due on the XXXX, electric, phones everything all due and I needed to get my kids stuff for XXXX still as we are a low income family my husband is a XXXX XXXX XXXX veteren, I am XXXX XXXX and we have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX children. So we have to really save and budget. We have almost no spare income but all our bills are always on time. So i go into the branch and with my XXXX kids to withdraw the funds like they told me to. I get to the teller and she looks everything up and writes down my account balances the main account without the fraud money or credits was {$420.00} the 2nd account was around {$1200.00} and the third was about {$790.00} so total was just above {$2400.00} and again that was not counting the credits for the fraud charges. So I told her i needed to withdraw that. She went and got a manager and the manager came out to tell me that they could only withdraw these amounts they could not withdraw the credits I had been issued etc I said thats fine i just need this I have bills and XXXX to pay for. She said okay I need 2 forms of ID and just give me one moment and went to the back and was there a while before returning to the window with two other individuals and stated that these were branch managers and that they were very sorry but they could not withdraw the funds from the accounts because the accounts were restricted and all deposits, withdrawals, wire transers, direct deposits, automatic bill pays everything blocked and restricted until they were done investigating the fraud and after that they had 10 business days to make a decision and close the account after that itll be 10 business days before they issue and mail me a check for the remaining balances. I said I understand that but I just spoke to you guys on the phone and was told I was not allowed access to any of the funds credited while you investigated but that the balance that wasnt included, our hard earned money that we saved for bills etc was. They said were sorry theres nothing we can do. I asked if i could just have one of the account balances the lowest one or even part of it. We had no access to any of our money at all and I just needed something to use to feed my family, cover gas, diapers, and just basic necessities to survive. They said were sorry no. So I went home and tried to figure out what to do. By the time I got home it was after XXXX and there was nothing else i could do as they were closed. So the next XXXX first thing I called chase again to explain i went to the office and they refused to let me withdraw the money. She said oh well yeah thats their disgression. I said what can i do??? I need access to some of our money, I have bills my kids need food. She said well you can try a different branch and see what they say. I asked about the direct deposits that were supposed to hit soon ( my husbands paycheck on friday, child support for my daughter on saturday and my childs XXXX  benefits on the XXXX ) she said they will all get denied and sent back to the sender as well as any other autodraft bill payments checks etc. I said this is unreal this is our money. So i called a different branch explained the situation to see if i went there if they would let me withdraw the available funds. She took my info and looked it up and said yes absolutely. She said let me just verify with my back office and call you back. About 30 min later she called me back and said that they would not be able to give me access to the funds either as corporate had restricted all withdrawals of funds too. So I asked her if there was anything I could do she said no I just had to wait for them to mail me the check. \\nI called corporate back and told them what this branch said and she said then theres nothing we can do youre just going to have to wait for the check. I said no this is not okay or right, we have been good loyal customers for over 5 years, we did nothing wrong i reported legitimate fraud on our account and because of that you made the decision to restrict and close our account without warning or any notice at all and hold all our income and restrict any and all access to it and leaving us with absolutely no money. I said my husband is a XXXX XXXX XXXX veteran for the XXXX XXXX, I am a XXXX XXXX stay at home mom and we have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX children and youre doing this right before XXXX leaving us with no way to feed ourselves or provide the bare minimus necessities, no way to do anything for our children for XXXX and holding all the money we had to pay our rent to keep a roof over our kids heads and utilites to keep our kids warm, car payment car insurance nothing and are telling me we wont have our money any of it till probably end of XXXX? She said sorry theres nothing we can do the account is restriced and closed and youll just have to wait for the check ... \\n\\nSo I hung up and called my mom and told her what was going on and she said thats not possible so I called chase back and conferenced her in and she heard everything and when i asked there reason for this decision they said it was theyre perogative to end our banking relationship due to too many fraud reports I said I said but there werent too many there were 3 back to back. Your claims department is the one that kept turning them into multiple report. she said sorry nothing we can do. I asked if there was anyway i could get access to any of the available money that was not part of the claim and she said no, I said we have direct deposits hitting and its too late to change it. She said they will get denied and sent back to the sender. So youll have to call them after. I said what about our bills that were already scheduled to come out the day you t the account the auto pay for our car insurance, phone bill and car payment. She said those were already denied. \\nSo I hung up and called ssi and waited for 90+ minutes and explained the situations and requested to change the payment method. she said because of the holidays it was too late to fix the XX/XX/XXXX payment in time but she updated it for future payments. She said that chase would refuse the deposit and it would go back to them within 48 hours and as soon as it did they would issue and mail me a check and the latest i would have that would be the XXXX. I broke down I explained everything and said i have no way to pay our rent or bills or XXXX for my kids nothing. She then asked me if the bank that was doing all this was chase bank. I said yes! she said they're horrible they do stuff like this to people all the time. she apologized profusely and I thanked her and hung up and called my husband to let him know. He said he changed his payment record but he doesnt know if its in time and if this paycheck would go on his new payroll card or chase but his employer issued him an emergency loan of {$100.00} to his card just so we could survive. I hung up and called child support and they said it would take 10 days to process so not in time to fix the payment scheduled for saturday but that they would also issue and mail a check when they got it back. \\n\\nSo I went home and did the application to open a new checking with a new financial institution. I got to the verification and none of the identity verification questions were anything having to do with any of my information and they said they couldnt verify my identity so they were denying my account, so I went to log onto my social security account and all of my log in info was changed. So i checked XXXX XXXX and that was changed too so I started researching, and started realizing my identity might have been stolen so I started XXXX what to do. ( I have never had anything like this happen we're low income and dont apply for credit or anything so I dont really monitor my credit report ) thats when they XXXX  breach info and website came up and i clicked the link and entered in my info to see if I was one of the people affected during this breach and it turns out my husband and I both were. so i started putting freezes on my credit and fraud alerts. Then I get a knock and received a certified letter from the IRS stating I was delinquent on my XXXX taxes and owe {$1500.00} immediately. I had never gotten my XXXX taxes it was being audited and they were still researching it. I tried to call irs but  the government is shut down so is the transcript website and identity theft reporting site. plus holidays so wasnt anything more i could do. XXXX came and went still no access to our money or anything so I was waiting for the ssi check in the mail. Well on XXXX XXXX I got a check in the mail from chase for {$1300.00} that stated it was for the remaing balance of my account ( s ) it didnt list which accounts or statement nothing but it was enough to cover rent and keep our lights on. I called when I got home to see what account it was for what it included etc. 3 different department managers couldnt tell me. they said they see the check was issued and mailed but nothing and that I had to just wait till everything was finalized and closed and then call and see if theyll be issuing more checks etc. \\n\\nI got notices from the place i financed my car through, XXXX and our cellphone internet and cable company stating the autodraft was declined and we needed to make immediate payments to avoid termination. \\n\\nOn XXXX second I received 11 claim update/ decision letters from chase stating that they had completed their investigations on those claims and determined they were charged and processed correctly so they were reversing the temporary credits to my account and would be removing the money on the XXXX. \\n\\nI also received an email from XXXX XXXX stating they could not file my taxes for this year as a return with mine, my husbands and childrens social security numbers and information had already been filed. I contacted XXXX XXXX and upon investigation all of our identities and everything from drivers liscences, social security numbers everything had been stolen so i researched and found out the tax fraud and false returns etc started back in XXXX and thats why IRS said i owed money. I pulled my credit reports and everything was changed and we had 72 inquiries and 15 fraudulent accounts opened on top of all of our personal info changed. I went to the police station and filed a report I explained everything and he said that this was why our bank account had all that fraud on it and how they got our debit card info and was able to charge everything when i hadnt even used the cards.. \\n\\nI got the police report number, an affidavit from the DMV plus whatever other documentation I could get right now including the fraud reports from the credit reporting agencies and called chase with the updates and requested to appeal their decisions based on the new information. It wasnt just fraud transactions my identity and all info had been stolen. \\n\\nShe said \" They didnt see any errors with the transaction or attempts to authorize a different amount so we We denied your claims because the transactions occurred within your geographical area, youve previously done business with the merchants, the card was in your possession and there were no bad PIN tries, and you monitored your account on chase.com during the time the fraudulent transactions were occurring, but didnt report them to us immediately. We mailed you a check for {$1300.00} Were sorry for any misunderstanding that may have occurred concerning how and when you would have access to the money in your account. We show this check paid on XX/XX/XXXX. The remaining money in your account ending in XXXX, which includes a direct deposit for {$770.00} that we received on XX/XX/XXXX will be held until your claims have been finalized. Your claim for the {$30.00} XXXX transaction is still being researched and has a final resolution date of XX/XX/XXXX. Well inform you of our claim decision in writing once it has been finalized. The remaining money in your account ending in XXXX, which includes a direct deposit for {$770.00}, will be held until your claims have been finalized. If any money is owed to you, well mail you a check. '' I said \" You accepted the Direct deposit of my daughters federal social security XXXX payment of {$770.00} on XX/XX/XXXX even though you completely restricted our accounts on the XXXX and rejected all of our automatic bill payments and refused to let me withdraw any of the funds in our account???? Now youre telling me youre going to hold it along with the rest of our account balance till you finalize the dispute XXXX first and will issue and send me a check for the remaining balance in 10 business days??? So you fraudulenty accepted and essentially stole my disable daughters monthly federal ssi payment for XXXX and are not going to release it or give us access to it till end of XXXX early XXXX? '' She said well I dont know anything about that or why is was accepted etc. \\nI said I want that resolved now or I will be filing a charges. Also I want to dispute the decisions made on my fraud claims they were absolutely not authorized and fraudulent they were a result of identity theft. I have never done any business with those online merchants ever! I dont ever shop online nor do I or have I ever spent that much money in single purchases. I notified you immediately when I realized the fraud I was not monitoring my account either. Theyre online not in my area. I am submitting the police report and all the documentation of the fraud including my information that was compromised in the credit reporting agency fraud. Including access to all my financial and personal accounts. Also saw 6-8 fraudulent inquiries for credit requests to you guys on my credit report that i want to dispute as well and know why i wasnt notified when my info was accessed and it was requested. \\n\\nThis was tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, I have not gotten any response to my appeal/ challenging of their decision nor have they released my daughters federal payment or even responded as to how and why they accepted the deposit 10 days after completely restricting my account refusing bills and holding my income.</td>\n",

              "      <td>I started a XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX company a few years ago, and I travel around the country visiting XXXX. In XX/XX/2016, I received 5+ missed calls while I was in DC for work. I had used my computer at the XXXX I was staying at and at a few coffee shops. I call the number back and a woman from XXXX, Texas asked, \" Is this ( company name )? I received a notification from my bank ( XXXX XXXX ) that there is suspicious activity and someone is trying to transfer money into my account. '' Me \" Yes, this is ( company name ). Who is this? I am not trying to transfer money, but I will check with my bank and call you back. '' When I check my account initially, I did not see any unusual payments. So assumed it was some sort of mistake. But then a few days later, I noticed a XXXX in the amount of {$3700.00} which I did not recognize. I was thinking that maybe I was paying an invoice to someone. But when I saw who is was going to, I had no idea who this person was, and there were no open invoices that matched that amount in my accounts payable. I reported there was a XXXX transfer made that I had no idea about, and I did not approve. It was not done by any of the signers on the account. Funds are returned to my account. \\n\\nI go into a physical Chase location, filed a claim for it, and we closed the bank account. I was told that I would receive an email with an attachment that I need to fax in. \\nSo I wait and wait, and after a couple weeks go by, I call chase and ask them what the status of my claim is. They said that they did not receive my faxed form and so there was no progress on the claim. I explained that I was still waiting to receive it via email. By the way, I was still receiving other chase notifications, so I assumed that they had my email correct. They said they would email it in 1-2 business days. I asked him on the phone if he could email it to me while we were talking so that I can make sure that I got it. He said he could not do that but assured me that I would receive it in 24-48 hours.. \\nI get a voicemail from Chase. \" We need more information to continue our research of your claim. Please call us as soon as possible and refer to claim number # # # # # # # # #. '' I called the number in the email and explained what happened. They told me that my claim was closed because I never faxed in the form, and I responded that I never received the form. Then the Chase Agent sent me a link that allowed me to download the chase form to fax. ( Why couldn't they do that in the first place? ) I asked him if I can speak with someone from the team that is doing the investigation, and he replied that I can not and they will contact me and to look out for a phone number starting with XXXX or XXXX. I fill out form and drop it off at Chase to be faxed in. \\n\\nThey never called despite me requesting over and over that they call me. My Chase agent was amazing and tried so hard to help me get ahold of someone in the Investigations team, but she ended up just sitting on the phone for hours with no luck. I was told that they tried to call me once, and I didn't answer so they never called again. I have even looked through my phone since then and have not missed any calls from a phone number starting with those digits. I had made sure that if I saw any XXXX or XXXX numbers calling me, I would answer immediately, even if I was in a meeting or busy with something else. \\n\\nA few days later, I receive an email from Chase saying they \" issued a temporary credit in the amount of {$3700.00} for claim # # # # # # # #. You'll have full use of the temporary funds while we do our research. '' Thanks for calling us. Welcome to theChaseCustomer Claims Secure Document Exchange I  called the woman who called me at the beginning saying that she had received the money in her XXXX XXXX Account, no answer. \\n\\nI notice that chase has removed the funds from my account.I spend 50 minutes on the phone with Chase and am transferred from person to person. I keep asking for more information so that I can understand what exactly is going on with my account, and why the claim was dropped. After a very long and frustrating conversation, the guy on the phone tells me that the reason they denied the claim was because there was another XXXX transfer made from the same IP address on for {$80.00} that I did not claim. I told him that I did not make that transfer and asked him to file a claim for both. He said that they already closed the claim and he could not reopen it. After arguing for 20 more minutes, he finally agreed to file a new claim for both of the amounts. Why couldn't he have done this the first time I asked? I also asked him over and over for information on the IP addresses that the transactions were made from so that I could help prove my case. He refused. \\n\\nSo I email my Chase Agent. She called Chase again and made sure they reopened claim. I emailed Chase Agent multiple to ask if there are any updates on my claim because I haven't heard anything. She keeps checking for me. \\n\\nChase Agent emails me back, \" I just got off the phone with the claims department. They said that this claim is going to remain denied because they can not find proof that it was fraudulent. You are welcome to come back into the branch and we can try to reach out to the claims dept together or you can reach them XXXX 1. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. '' At this point, I have been talking to Chase for months, and I am super frustrated with everything in the Investigations and fraud department. It is very obvious that their goal is to not help you figure out what happened to your money. So I ask my Chase Agent if she can find outwhat EXACTLY they need from me to prove it was hacked.If they do not give me specifics I will ask my lawyer to step in. I also asked her if she could help me get information on the IP addresses that the transactions were made from so that I could help prove my case. From my standpoint, they are not even trying to help me they are just trying to throw my case out. It is also ridiculous that they have not even called me to talk to me about it and try to work with me to find a way to prove that this was fraud. I have NO information, and they are making it so incredibly difficult to get information about this fraud claim. \\n\\nSo I realize that I have a friend from college that works for Chase, so I go and visit him. He helps me take my case to their Escalations Dept. The Escalations Dept calls me and I tell her the whole story and she says she will call me back on Friday with updates ( 1 hr 20 minute conversation ) She says that she can not help me because the fraud dept is telling her that the IP address used for the 2 disputed transactions is still currently being used to monitor the account. At this point I am concerned that \" they are still monitoring my account. '' Again I asked for IP address information, but again, they refused. \\n\\nI call Chase again and the agent tells me that is NOT being used to monitor my account, which doesn't make sense because that was the very reason that I was told by the Escalations Dept that it was closed to begin with. \\n\\nAt this point, I realize that Chase is not going to help me at all. So I call the number of the woman who called me at the beginning. The person who answers claims to be an someone else and she doesn't know what I am talking about. Then she calls me back and says, \" I am ( her name ) and I do have your money. It was transferred in my account at XXXX XXXX and the bank put a hold on the account because I could not verify who was sending it. '' She said that she would return it to my account. But her story kept changing. First she had the full amount, then she said that she only had {$2500.00}. She told me that should were call her bank and have them return the money. \\n\\nStop in Branch to tell my agent the whole story. She brings her manager in too. I told them that I was going to get a lawyer involved, and they gave me the number to the Chase Executive Office Line. I call them and they say they will get back to me within 48 hours. \\n\\nThe gentleman from the Executive Office Line said that they could not prove that it was fraud because they were sent from my personal computer, the same one that I am currently using right now. So someone hacked into my computer without my knowledge and charged my account, and there is nothing they can do about it even though I DID NOT send or approve either of the 2 transactions.</td>\n",

If the signature of more than one person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account.\\n\\n( b ) A stop-payment order is effective for six months, but it lapses after 14 calendar days if the original order was oral and was not confirmed in a record within that period. A stop-payment order may be renewed for additional six-month periods by a record given to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order is effective.\\n\\n( c ) The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer. The loss from payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under Section 4-402. \\n\\nThe account retains a invisible button on this date.Called I DO NOT WANT OVERDRAFT.

Now the insight of Chase bank i have accessed the forum to request the bank communicate if i am insufficient in allowing a payment i stopped to be paid and itemizing what Chase bank is going to pay. That i may request in depository rules other than FDIC my income that as a Insurance company can go to limit per day.

              "      <td>On XX/XX/XXXX there was a hail storm in XXXX XXXX South Dakota. I filed a claim with my insurance company. The insurance company looked at the damage on XXXX and gave me a check, that same day, made out to myself and Chase XXXX. I called Chase XXXX the same day and asked them how to proceed. I talked to XXXX and he rudely informed me of my options. One of my options was to come up with the remaining balance and pay off my vehicle. I later chose that option. On XX/XX/XXXX I went to my Credit Union and got a loan for the remaining balance of the car loan. My Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX, took the Insurance Check from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( check # XXXX ) for {$7100.00}, the cashiers check from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( check # XXXX ) for {$3700.00} and a letter she had typed up explaining that there were 2 checks enclosed to pay off my XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail from Chase telling me that the check I sent for {$7100.00} was not enough to pay off my vehicle and I needed to call them back to address the situation. I immediate called them back and explained that there were 2 checks in the envelope to pay off my car. The woman I talked to said there was not 2 checks in the envelope. she said the only thing in the envelope was the 1 check from XXXX. I told her that in fact there was 2 checks as well as a letter indicating what the 2 checks were for. She immediately became very rude and argumentative with me. I told her I knew for a fact what was in the envelope, because I was in the office with my loan officer when she put the 2 checks and the letter in the envelope, sealed it and set it for the mail. I expressed my concern that the check for {$3700.00} was floating around there somewhere and I would be held responsible for it. The woman told me I had to contact XXXX and put a stop payment on the cashiers check. In a state of frustration and anger I said I would do that. She said she would note it on my account that I was going to put the stop payment on that check. I immediately called XXXX and she said that you can not put a stop payment on a cashiers check and told me what I needed to do. I then called Chase back relayed this information. I got someone else on the phone the second time and I had to go thru the whole story again. The second person told me she only showed the check from XXXX being in the envelope. I asked her about the letter and she asked me to hold, she said she was looking through the notes. She then said in fact the letter was there with the check. I asked her what was going to happen if the Cashiers check magically appeared. She said she would note in my account what I was doing to get the problem fixed and also to hold the check for {$3700.00} if it appeared at Chase. After I did what I needed to do at the credit Union I called Chase and told them what I did. The 3rd Person I talked to told me that the insurance check had been mailed back to me. I told her that that was wrong and they were supposed to be on hold until everything was squared away. She insisted multiple times that it was mailed out. I asked her when it was mailed out. she put me on hold and came back on the line and said that in fact it had not been mailed out and she had it there in her possession. She said she was able to get it out of the mail room before it went out. She said she would get it taken care of for me. On XX/XX/XXXX I called chase again to get an update on what was going on. The 4th person I talked to said both checks were mailed back.She said that 1 of the checks was mailed to me and the other one was mailed to my ex husband at an address that we haven't lived at for, at the very least, 3 years. I asked her what she meant by both checks and she said the Insurance check and the cashiers check, so this means the cashiers check did in fact, magically appear. I immediately insisted I talked to a supervisor. I was transferred to XXXX XXXX at extension # XXXX at XXXX XXXX.. I explained the story in its entirety from the very first phone call back on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX started off the conversation in an argumentative manner. He told me many things. He said the conversation with Woman # 3 had never happened. I insisted it did and his reply was \" there was no note of it in the computer so the conversation didn't happen. He told me that XXXX didn't know what she was talking about and you can in fact stop payment on a cashiers check, he has been in the banking business for X amount of years and he knew what he was talking about and XXXX was wrong. He was telling me that the reason they did not apply the money to the account was because the Insurance estimate was not in with the envelope for the repairs. I told him that they didn't need the estimate to pay off the loan and he continuously insisted they did. when I challenged him as to why they needed the repair estimate, when I was, in fact, not getting my vehicle fixed, I was paying it off, he then changed his story and said I did not need the estimate. He confirmed one of the checks was sent to my ex husband at a different address than mine. I asked why it was not sent to me and he said it was because XXXX name was also on the check and that was the address they had on file for him. I told him I had sent Chase a letter informing them of our new address over a year ago and he confirmed that they did have the new address for me. I asked why they didn't have it changed for XXXX ( my now ex husband ), he said XXXX didn't send in a letter. I told him the letter stated it was to change the address for both of us. It included both of our names, date of births and account number and that XXXX and I both signed the letter. He then went quite for a brief moment and avoided answering the question. I asked when the checks were mailed out. He said the Insurance check was mailed out to me on XXXX and the cashiers check was sent to XXXX, at the wrong address, on XXXX. I later received a letter dated XXXX that the check was mailed back to me on XXXX and not XXXX. I also expressed my concerns about having a late payment as well as my deep concerns of this affecting my credit. I had not made my XXXX payment because I was under the impression that my car was paid off from the transaction taking place back on XXXX and then the fact that I was in constant contact with Chase about this whole situation. I also knew if I went ahead and made my XXXX payment it would adjust my payoff balance in which I had already sent the exact amount of money for. I asked if they were going to wave any late payments and/or penalties because of this being their error. He said in fact no they would not cover those. It was my responsibility to pay those. I argued this point and then he said they \" might '' cover it if it's a couple bucks, but he would have to look into that. I did later receive the insurance check from Chase in the mail. I knew that I would not receive the Cashiers check because the Post Office only forwards mail for 1 year, I only had to hope the current resident of the apartment did the right thing and would send it back to Chase. On XXXX I went back to the Credit Union with the Insurance check and we were going to send it, a new cashiers check and letter to Chase. At some point and time somehow Chase got the Cashiers check back in their possession and applied it to my account on XXXX. XXXX and I called Chase and Talked to XXXX at extension XXXX at XXXX XXXX. because the Insurance check was stamped for deposit but there was another stamp over the deposit stamp making it invalid and not depositable. XXXX had to check with her supervisor to find out if it was ok to send that check back or if we needed to get a new check from XXXX. she called XXXX back a day or two later and told her it was ok to send the original check to them. XXXX did send the original insurance check back to Chase for payment in full. I called every day and frequently twice a day to confirm that they had received the check and my car had in fact finally been paid off. Finally on Tuesday XXXX when I called, the recording indicated my car was paid off. \\n\\nThe Companies involved are as follows : Chase XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, South Dakota XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Florida XXXX XXXX</td>\n",

I pulled out clothing, towels, ruined items, furniture, etc. \\nThey sent an adjuster. At his visit he said that he was approving me for an {$8000.00} building check to get started. And to go ahead and contact my mortgage company, because they would need to endorse it as well. He also told me that I could pull out anything wet. He informed me that I did not have to have a license contractor to do work in the house. I could choose who I wanted or do it myself. \\nI immediately called Chase, told them I flooded, have a check coming and asked what did I need to do. The woman told me to write down a tracking number, sign the check and submit to them so they could endorse it. At this time I didnt know that they kept the money and dealt it out to me.

Saw that online. Had no notification. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Found out forms were not waived by chase. Talked to XXXX XXXX asked why inspection was cancelled. She said ( the second time I have been told this ) that the notes say the inspection was cancelled because they tried to contact me. Thats what Ive been told both times. She said that the reason was probably because I still didnt have a licensed contractor, even though it was noted otherwise. I never had any calls from inspectors or messages even though they said I had at least 6 calls concerning. I asked to speak with a supervisor, got XXXX XXXX, resolution specialist/account supervisor. Needed a license and the request was never approved. She said you can request anything you want, doesnt mean youre going to get it. Thats the point of a request. All said in a matter of fact and condescending tone. I informed her Chase had told me to do the request in the first place and ensured me it was fine for my situation. \\nXX/XX/XXXX 3rd Inspection requested XX/XX/XXXX Letter mailed by chase saying received exception request but cant approve until they have paid in full invoices and valid receipts exceeding {$28000.00} released thus far. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Inspector called to make inspection appointment. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Toilet and sink in full bath installed XX/XX/XXXX Chase mailed letter that said theyve approved my exception request and will send me an insurance claim funds check by XX/XX/XXXX.

No money until they get a contractor license and lien waiver. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Uploaded contractors lien waiver and XXXX contract and letter requesting reimbursement and final receipt. XX/XX/XXXX I had requested a check for him from chase. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Talked to XXXX at XXXX. Said I needed a contractors license or things could be made simpler if I switch to self-contractor. I said I had never heard that was possible, and first time I knew it was an option. She said it was possible if I had a current mortgage with them. Though if she switched me over to self-contracting, that I couldnt use the insurance check site and had to pay all out of pocket first then get submitted when totally done. I said I dont feel comfortable switching, I need to speak with my lawyer on what I should do because a ) I need an electronic record of everything and self-contracting relies on faxing and mail b ) how do I can I be ensured the money will come to me at the end? She said she was going to call XXXX to see if instead of a license he could produce proof of insurance / surety bond. I said feel free. She said that would work to release my funds. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Talked with XXXX XXXX at Chase because they released {$450.00} I asked what for, it was for XXXX receipts of mitigation supplies. I told her I thought I was told I wasnt getting any more money until done because I still had plenty of unpaid receipts. She said if I could send in the XXXX XXXX {$6500.00} cancelled check, that they would reimburse me for that, but not release any more funds. She also said the notes said XXXX XXXX had been called but no answer on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Chase called me to inform me that they cancelled my check request to pay XXXX XXXX {$6500.00} since I had submitted a receipt that said paid. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Flooring laid XX/XX/XXXX Cabinets installed. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Floors to be sealed.</td>\n",

              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy.

              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

It turned the agent was giving me the wrong information in order to upgrade the account. XXXX   changed my anniversary date from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX without my consent! XXXX has the recording of the agent who was misled me.   \n",

              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full. The payment was no process with my bank until XX/XX/XXXX because the due date was over the weekend. Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

It turned the agent was giving me the wrong information in order to upgrade the account. XXXX   changed my anniversary date from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX without my consent! XXXX has the recording of the agent who was misled me.   \n",

              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018.

By comparison th e Sapphire was the better card ( especially when I believed the intro rate was also on the sapphire ) so this was the card I  chose to be my everyday card. The plan was to use the card and made multiple payments per month to keep the balance down and especially since there 's an introductory rate.

immediately removed from my credit card. \\n\\nAdditional evidence : I have never purchased a XXXX  ( or any spa treatment ) that was that expensive, which Chase can tell from my consumer behavior on

              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018.

On XX/XX/XXXX, the late payment reappeared, dropping my score from XXXX to XXXX. Since then, I have attempted to apply for credit and have been negatively affected by this supposed \\\" late payment '' that has appeared, disappeared, and then reappeared. Something is definitely wrong with this account as it has been reported, it has had a negative effect on my ability to get credit from reputable financial institutions, and I request that the account history from all three bureaus be updated to reflect \\\" paid as agreed '' on this account. Please see all my other accounts as a reference to my positive credit behavior, and please help me resolve this potentially invalid information so that my payment history can be accurately and positively reflected.\",\n          \"Applied for  XXXX  credit cards in  XXXX  of  2016 a t the same time.  The Sapphire and the Freedom . The application process and disclosures on t he Sapphire led me t o believe th at the Sapphire had  an 0 % introductory rate. The most noticeable difference between the  XXXX  cards was  XXXX  was used for travel and had a hefty annual fee and the freedom did not. By comparison th e Sapphire was the better card ( especially when I believed the intro rate was also on the sapphire ) so this was the card I  chose to be my everyday card. The plan was to use the card and made multiple payments per month to keep the balance down and especially since there 's an introductory rate. I unfortunately only found out recently, after noticing all the payments ive been making is not catching up to the balance. This led me to take a closer look at my statement and in shock, discovered I 'd been charged interest every month since  XXXX     2016. W hen I called  Chase, they explained the Sapphire has never had an intro rate promotion ( despite offering the card closely with other Chase credit card products with introductory rates ). When I asked if they could help with the interest I 've been charged, they simply reiterated that the Sapphire card has never had a promotional rate and there 's nothing they could do.   I feel so violated and misled thinking I 'm using my credit card well and now I have this mounting interest charge I was never clear about from the first place.\",\n          \"On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a XXXX dollar charge on my Chase freedom credit card that was listed as \\\" XXXX. '' Within less than an hour of the charge hitting my account, I reached out to both XXXX and Chase to report the charge as fraudulent. My Groupon it listed it as a XXXX for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  '' that I did not purchase. \\n\\nXXXX immediately offered me a refund option including a full refund back to my card ( screenshots attached ) but when I reached out to Chase they had already removed the charge and canceled the card at my request, so I believed the matter was handled, and told XXXX we were all set. At that point in the time the XXXX was listed as refunded in my app ( screenshot attached ). I removed my card from the XXXX app so no more fraudulent purchases could be made and changed my password. \\n\\nA month later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the charge had been reinstated on my chase account for XXXX from Groupon ( still listed as XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. I immediately called Chase and requested it be removed. I spoke to a woman named XXXX, and sent her a lot of supporting documentation ( all attached ) that I had originally ( within an hour of the charge ) reported the charge as fraudulent, and that XXXX had offered a refund but since Chase had already removed the fraudulent charge and canceled my card I thought we were all set. \\n\\nFor almost a month after this I have been given the runaround by Chase. \\nI have made over XXXX calls to their fraud center XXXX XXXX : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) and have submitted all the supporting documentation submitted to this complaint ( screenshots all attached ). The Chase fraud team has been dismissive and has been unresponsive for weeks at a time at times, not making a good faith effort to reach out to me with updates. \\n\\nWhenever I reach back out to XXXX, they tell me to work with Chase to resolve. But Chase has told me that XXXX has submitted documentation to \\\" prove '' the purchase was made by me, but despite me asking has not shared the information with me. Chase is therefore saying I should work with XXXX to get a refund, not Chase. XXXX claims the account was accessed by an android phone ( I do not own an android phone ). I have also not used the XXXX ( because I didn't purchase it ) and now XXXX has XXXX my account so I can not even access the account to request another refund directly in app. Whenever I reach out to XXXX ( they do not have a phone number ) I get a different agent, and have to start all over again. \\n\\nAs you'll see from the documentation, XXXX had originally offered me a refund, so based on this offer of an initial refund, and the fact that this was an unauthorized use of my account ( even if Chase doesn't believe me that the charge was fraudulent ), I would like the XXXX dollar charge immediately removed from my credit card. \\n\\nAdditional evidence : I have never purchased a XXXX  ( or any spa treatment ) that was that expensive, which Chase can tell from my consumer behavior on their app. I also immediately requested a new credit card and reached out to both institutions to get this remedied ( within an hour of the charge ).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once I made XXXX direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in 10 days. As of XXXX I had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the 21 days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.   \n",

I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did   \n",

They opened a ticket, got escalated to their tech team, but when I would call back to find out what happened, they told me that the case had been closed. This happened 3 times, and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information. \\n\\nGoing from ultimaterewards.com and chase.com have the  same result. \\n\\nI'm not able to use these points by phone either, because the operators for the Travel Center are not able to access my account/points neither. \\n\\nI've tried every browser, both XXXX and XXXX computers, and the XXXX Chase phone application. They all send me to the page that says \" We are unable to complete your request at this time '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked up some people that work in Ultimate Rewards on XXXX, and cold called a VP of Customer Relations. He acted like he was helpful at first, and we exchanged some emails. He eventually said I can buy a flight/hotel using Chase Sapphire and if I give him the details, he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase. \\n\\nLong story short, he wasn't able to fix anything. \\n\\nI can see that I'm still collecting points, but I haven't been able to access it. \\n\\nI travel a lot, and it's become a huge inconvenience that I'm not able to access these points which I intended to use for travel. I need to get this issue resolved ASAP.   \n",

It turned the agent was giving me the wrong information in order to upgrade the account. XXXX   changed my anniversary date from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX without my consent! XXXX has the recording of the agent who was misled me.   \n",

I made payments of {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The minimum payment was {$140.00}. The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase.

Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. I would like CFPB help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since I have been clear reason for denial.   \n",

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I have made several attempts to get chase bank to contact the bureau and remove this inquiry that was not authorized by me. They seem to not be able to get me to the right person to take care of this issue no matter how many attempts I have made nobody seems to understand what I'm talkin about. I want chase bank to have this fraudulent inquiry removed from my credit report before I take legal action. I I have never requested any kind of credit with chase bank or hold any account with them.

When Chase refund, they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place.   \n",

I was charged twice for this transaction. I placed a disputes case with Chase bank on XX/XX/2019 when I noticed the charge on my account. I called back on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 about the provisional credit for the charge and again on Monday, XX/XX/2019. I was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.   \n",

              "8   On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.   \n",

On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction.

I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.</td>\n",

'' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer.

I am asking the bank to validate the debt. Instead I been receiving mail every month from them attempting to collect a debt. \\nI have a right to know this information as a consumer. \\n\\nChase account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thanks in advance for your help.   \n",

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased three high school textbooks for my XXXX year old daughter because she transferred to a new school. All three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke. The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim. '' By the time the call ended I received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and was being denied. I find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent.   \n",
              "21056  I am not familiar with XXXX pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers. I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly. I would not have clicked on the to link to the extent I did if I would have been better informed.   \n",

I've had Chase credit cards, \" Chase Freedom '' specifically since XXXX with no problems ever. I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids & many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable & reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit. I could easily transfer again to a different card, but I'd have to pay another lump sum of $ again.   \n",

I did that to close out my account roughly {$500.00} payment when I closed out the accounts, and now I get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after 10+ years stating I owe close to {$900.00} dollars. I have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the 10+ years because I paid it off. Upon calling them I am told I need to show proof I paid it off. I would like to think that if indeed I had not paid it off ( which I did ) I would have immediately received late payment notifications. I left Chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions.   \n",

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased three high school textbooks for my XXXX year old daughter because she transferred to a new school. All three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke. The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim.

I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly.

I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX.

I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG &amp; I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids &amp; many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable &amp; reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person.

On XX/XX/XXXX, the late payment reappeared, dropping my score from XXXX to XXXX. Since then, I have attempted to apply for credit and have been negatively affected by this supposed \\\" late payment '' that has appeared, disappeared, and then reappeared. Something is definitely wrong with this account as it has been reported, it has had a negative effect on my ability to get credit from reputable financial institutions, and I request that the account history from all three bureaus be updated to reflect \\\" paid as agreed '' on this account. Please see all my other accounts as a reference to my positive credit behavior, and please help me resolve this potentially invalid information so that my payment history can be accurately and positively reflected.\",\n          \"Applied for  XXXX  credit cards in  XXXX  of  2016 a t the same time.  The Sapphire and the Freedom . The application process and disclosures on t he Sapphire led me t o believe th at the Sapphire had  an 0 % introductory rate. The most noticeable difference between the  XXXX  cards was  XXXX  was used for travel and had a hefty annual fee and the freedom did not. By comparison th e Sapphire was the better card ( especially when I believed the intro rate was also on the sapphire ) so this was the card I  chose to be my everyday card. The plan was to use the card and made multiple payments per month to keep the balance down and especially since there 's an introductory rate. I unfortunately only found out recently, after noticing all the payments ive been making is not catching up to the balance. This led me to take a closer look at my statement and in shock, discovered I 'd been charged interest every month since  XXXX     2016. W hen I called  Chase, they explained the Sapphire has never had an intro rate promotion ( despite offering the card closely with other Chase credit card products with introductory rates ). When I asked if they could help with the interest I 've been charged, they simply reiterated that the Sapphire card has never had a promotional rate and there 's nothing they could do.   I feel so violated and misled thinking I 'm using my credit card well and now I have this mounting interest charge I was never clear about from the first place.\",\n          \"On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a XXXX dollar charge on my Chase freedom credit card that was listed as \\\" XXXX. '' Within less than an hour of the charge hitting my account, I reached out to both XXXX and Chase to report the charge as fraudulent. My Groupon it listed it as a XXXX for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  '' that I did not purchase. \\n\\nXXXX immediately offered me a refund option including a full refund back to my card ( screenshots attached ) but when I reached out to Chase they had already removed the charge and canceled the card at my request, so I believed the matter was handled, and told XXXX we were all set. At that point in the time the XXXX was listed as refunded in my app ( screenshot attached ). I removed my card from the XXXX app so no more fraudulent purchases could be made and changed my password. \\n\\nA month later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the charge had been reinstated on my chase account for XXXX from Groupon ( still listed as XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. I immediately called Chase and requested it be removed. I spoke to a woman named XXXX, and sent her a lot of supporting documentation ( all attached ) that I had originally ( within an hour of the charge ) reported the charge as fraudulent, and that XXXX had offered a refund but since Chase had already removed the fraudulent charge and canceled my card I thought we were all set. \\n\\nFor almost a month after this I have been given the runaround by Chase. \\nI have made over XXXX calls to their fraud center XXXX XXXX : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) and have submitted all the supporting documentation submitted to this complaint ( screenshots all attached ). The Chase fraud team has been dismissive and has been unresponsive for weeks at a time at times, not making a good faith effort to reach out to me with updates. \\n\\nWhenever I reach back out to XXXX, they tell me to work with Chase to resolve. But Chase has told me that XXXX has submitted documentation to \\\" prove '' the purchase was made by me, but despite me asking has not shared the information with me. Chase is therefore saying I should work with XXXX to get a refund, not Chase. XXXX claims the account was accessed by an android phone ( I do not own an android phone ). I have also not used the XXXX ( because I didn't purchase it ) and now XXXX has XXXX my account so I can not even access the account to request another refund directly in app. Whenever I reach out to XXXX ( they do not have a phone number ) I get a different agent, and have to start all over again. \\n\\nAs you'll see from the documentation, XXXX had originally offered me a refund, so based on this offer of an initial refund, and the fact that this was an unauthorized use of my account ( even if Chase doesn't believe me that the charge was fraudulent ), I would like the XXXX dollar charge immediately removed from my credit card. \\n\\nAdditional evidence : I have never purchased a XXXX  ( or any spa treatment ) that was that expensive, which Chase can tell from my consumer behavior on their app. I also immediately requested a new credit card and reached out to both institutions to get this remedied ( within an hour of the charge ).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

I am asking the bank to validate the debt. Instead I been receiving mail every month from them attempting to collect a debt. \\nI have a right to know this information as a consumer. \\n\\nChase account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thanks in advance for your help.   \n",

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased three high school textbooks for my XXXX year old daughter because she transferred to a new school. All three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke. The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim. '' By the time the call ended I received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and was being denied. I find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent.   \n",
              "21056  I am not familiar with XXXX pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers. I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly. I would not have clicked on the to link to the extent I did if I would have been better informed.   \n",

I've had Chase credit cards, \" Chase Freedom '' specifically since XXXX with no problems ever. I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids & many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable & reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment.

I did that to close out my account roughly {$500.00} payment when I closed out the accounts, and now I get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after 10+ years stating I owe close to {$900.00} dollars. I have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the 10+ years because I paid it off. Upon calling them I am told I need to show proof I paid it off. I would like to think that if indeed I had not paid it off ( which I did ) I would have immediately received late payment notifications. I left Chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions.   \n",

I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly.

I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX &amp; was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG &amp; I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids &amp; many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable &amp; reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person.

Since then, I have attempted to apply for credit and have been negatively affected by this supposed \\\" late payment '' that has appeared, disappeared, and then reappeared. Something is definitely wrong with this account as it has been reported, it has had a negative effect on my ability to get credit from reputable financial institutions, and I request that the account history from all three bureaus be updated to reflect \\\" paid as agreed '' on this account. Please see all my other accounts as a reference to my positive credit behavior, and please help me resolve this potentially invalid information so that my payment history can be accurately and positively reflected.\",\n          \"Applied for  XXXX  credit cards in  XXXX  of  2016 a t the same time.  The Sapphire and the Freedom . The application process and disclosures on t he Sapphire led me t o believe th at the Sapphire had  an 0 % introductory rate. The most noticeable difference between the  XXXX  cards was  XXXX  was used for travel and had a hefty annual fee and the freedom did not. By comparison th e Sapphire was the better card ( especially when I believed the intro rate was also on the sapphire ) so this was the card I  chose to be my everyday card. The plan was to use the card and made multiple payments per month to keep the balance down and especially since there 's an introductory rate. I unfortunately only found out recently, after noticing all the payments ive been making is not catching up to the balance. This led me to take a closer look at my statement and in shock, discovered I 'd been charged interest every month since  XXXX     2016. W hen I called  Chase, they explained the Sapphire has never had an intro rate promotion ( despite offering the card closely with other Chase credit card products with introductory rates ). When I asked if they could help with the interest I 've been charged, they simply reiterated that the Sapphire card has never had a promotional rate and there 's nothing they could do.   I feel so violated and misled thinking I 'm using my credit card well and now I have this mounting interest charge I was never clear about from the first place.\",\n          \"On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a XXXX dollar charge on my Chase freedom credit card that was listed as \\\" XXXX. '' Within less than an hour of the charge hitting my account, I reached out to both XXXX and Chase to report the charge as fraudulent. My Groupon it listed it as a XXXX for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  '' that I did not purchase. \\n\\nXXXX immediately offered me a refund option including a full refund back to my card ( screenshots attached ) but when I reached out to Chase they had already removed the charge and canceled the card at my request, so I believed the matter was handled, and told XXXX we were all set. At that point in the time the XXXX was listed as refunded in my app ( screenshot attached ). I removed my card from the XXXX app so no more fraudulent purchases could be made and changed my password. \\n\\nA month later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the charge had been reinstated on my chase account for XXXX from Groupon ( still listed as XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. I immediately called Chase and requested it be removed. I spoke to a woman named XXXX, and sent her a lot of supporting documentation ( all attached ) that I had originally ( within an hour of the charge ) reported the charge as fraudulent, and that XXXX had offered a refund but since Chase had already removed the fraudulent charge and canceled my card I thought we were all set. \\n\\nFor almost a month after this I have been given the runaround by Chase. \\nI have made over XXXX calls to their fraud center XXXX XXXX : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) and have submitted all the supporting documentation submitted to this complaint ( screenshots all attached ). The Chase fraud team has been dismissive and has been unresponsive for weeks at a time at times, not making a good faith effort to reach out to me with updates. \\n\\nWhenever I reach back out to XXXX, they tell me to work with Chase to resolve. But Chase has told me that XXXX has submitted documentation to \\\" prove '' the purchase was made by me, but despite me asking has not shared the information with me. Chase is therefore saying I should work with XXXX to get a refund, not Chase. XXXX claims the account was accessed by an android phone ( I do not own an android phone ). I have also not used the XXXX ( because I didn't purchase it ) and now XXXX has XXXX my account so I can not even access the account to request another refund directly in app. Whenever I reach out to XXXX ( they do not have a phone number ) I get a different agent, and have to start all over again. \\n\\nAs you'll see from the documentation, XXXX had originally offered me a refund, so based on this offer of an initial refund, and the fact that this was an unauthorized use of my account ( even if Chase doesn't believe me that the charge was fraudulent ), I would like the XXXX dollar charge immediately removed from my credit card. \\n\\nAdditional evidence : I have never purchased a XXXX  ( or any spa treatment ) that was that expensive, which Chase can tell from my consumer behavior on their app. I also immediately requested a new credit card and reached out to both institutions to get this remedied ( within an hour of the charge ).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          4,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
